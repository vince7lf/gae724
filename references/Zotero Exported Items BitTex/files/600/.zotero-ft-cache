Abstract View references (24)

Traditional image recognition technology currently cannot achieve the fast real-time high-accuracy performance necessary for road recognition in intelligent driving. Deep learning models have been recently emerging as promising tools to achieve this performance. The recognition performance of such models can be boosted using appropriate selection of the activation functions. This paper proposes a deep learning approach for the classification of road surface conditions, and constructs a new activation function based on the rectified linear unit Rectified Linear Units (ReLu) activation function. The experimental results show a classification accuracy of 94.89% on the road state database. Experiments on public datasets demonstrate that the proposed convolutional neural network model with the improved activation function has better generalization and excellent classification performance. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Field-Weighted Citation Impact Field-Weighted Citation Impact shows how well cited this document is when compared to similar documents. A value greater than 1.00 means the document is more cited than expected according to the average. It takes into account:

    The year of publication
    Document type, and
    Disciplines associated with its source.

The FWCI is the ratio of the document's citations to the average number of citations received by all similar documents over a three-year window. Each discipline makes an equal contribution to the metric, which eliminates differences in researcher citation behavior.
