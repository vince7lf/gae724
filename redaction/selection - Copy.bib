	abstract = {Mapping key areas for ecosystem service ({ES}) supply is essential for the development of strategies that will ensure their future supply. Given the rapid development in this area of research, we performed a review of different approaches used to map {ES}, with a special focus on those that use social–ecological data. We used an analytical framework based on five criteria for analyzing and comparing the methodological approaches: the types of {ES}, availability of data sources, types of data sources, spatial scale, and methods used to model {ES}. We found that regulating services were the most commonly mapped, followed by provisioning, cultural, and supporting services. Secondary (readily available) data were used more frequently than primary data to map {ES}. Biophysical data (land-cover variables) and mixed sources (databases like global statistics) were the most commonly employed ones. Most studies were performed at the regional or at the national scale. The most commonly used method to model services was the development of models based on the well-known causal relationships between environmental variables, followed by the extrapolation of {ES} values from primary data to the total analyzed area frequently using land-cover maps. Our synthesis reveals that the majority of studies are based on secondary data, applied at broad scales, without validation techniques. There is an urgent need to develop methods for deepening our understanding of the social–ecological processes behind the supply of {ES} in order to improve our ability to map {ES} for decision making.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.ecolind.2015.03.016},
	abstract = {Mapping the demand for ecosystem services ({ES}) has received increased attention in scientific research and is seen as a relevant tool to inform conservation planning, land use planning and management. Yet, there is a varying understanding of the concept of {ES} demand, which has implications on how and where {ES} demand is being mapped. In this paper we review the current conceptual understanding of {ES} demand, indicators to measure demand and the approaches used to quantify and map demand. We identified four distinct “demand types”, which relate to different ecosystem service categories. These demand types include demand expressed in terms of (1) risk reduction, (2) preferences and values, (3) direct use or (4) consumption of goods and services. Each of the demand types was linked to specific methods applied in the reviewed literature. We found that operationalization of {ES} demand in policy, planning and management requires a more consistent understanding and definition of {ES} demand, its drivers and its temporal dynamics. Furthermore, the impact of demands for multiple ecosystem services on land use change needs to be investigated. This will allow for the consideration of temporal and cross-level interactions between supply and demand of ecosystem services and its impacts in land use change modelling.},

	abstract = {This study aims at providing a new method to efficiently analyze detailed urban ecological conditions at the example of Shanghai, one of the world's most densely populated megacities. The main objective is to develop a method to effectively analyze high-resolution optical satellite data for mapping of ecologically important urban space and to evaluate ecological changes through the emerging ecosystem service supply and demand concept. Two {IKONOS} and {GeoEye}-1 scenes were used to determine land use/land cover change in Shanghai's urban core from 2000 to 2009. After preprocessing, the images were segmented and classified into seven distinct urban land use/land cover classes through {SVM}. The classes were then transformed into ecosystem service supply and demand budgets for regulating, provisioning and cultural services, and ecological integrity based on ecosystem functions. Decreases in continuous urban fabric and industrial areas in the favor of urban green sites and high-rise areas with commercial/residential function could be observed resulting in an increase of at least 20\% in service supply budgets. Main contributor to the change is the decrease in continuous urban fabric and industrial areas. The overall results and outcome of the study strengthen the suggested application of the proposed method for urban ecosystem service budget mapping with hitherto for that purpose unutilized high-resolution data. The insights and results from this study might further contribute to sustainable urban planning, prove common grounds for interurban comparisons, or aid in enhancing ecological intraurban functionality by analyzing the distribution of urban ecospace and lead to improved accessibility and proximity to ecosystem services in urban areas. © 2008-2012 {IEEE}.},

	abstract = {This study explores the use of ecosystem service ({ES}) knowledge to support urban planning in the assessment of future scenarios. The case study concerns the prioritszation of brownfield regeneration interventions in the city of Trento (Italy). Alternative planning scenarios considering the conversion of existing brownfields into new urban parks are assessed and compared. The assessment focuses on two {ES} of critical importance for the city, namely microclimate regulation and nature-based recreation. The benefits of the different scenarios are quantified based on the number of expected beneficiaries broken down into different vulnerability classes and then compared through a multi-criteria analysis. Three combinations of criteria and weights reflect different planning objectives and related decision-makers' orientations about what {ES} and beneficiary groups should be prioritised. The application demonstrates the potential for {ES} assessments to support urban planning processes in the specific phase of assessment and selection of alternatives, by meeting the requirements in terms of both sensitivity to small-scale changes in land uses or management activities and capacity to capture simultaneous variations in supply and demand of multiple {ES}. Being coherent with socially-orientated planning objectives, indicators based on {ES} demand and beneficiaries can effectively convey information about {ES} in planning decisions. Multi-criteria analysis is an effective way to integrate multiple {ES} assessments with other information about costs and benefits of planning scenarios, exploring diverse stakeholder perspectives and balancing competing objectives in a rational and transparent way. © Cortinovis C, Geneletti D.},

	doi = {10.3897/oneeco.2.e14499},
	abstract = {Urban ecosystems are the areas where built infrastructure covers a large proportion of the land surface but the main source of ecosystem services provision is the green infrastructure. This provision is very much dependent on the particular combination of green spaces such as parks or vegetation belts and paved areas such as buildings and streets. The spatial arrangement of these elements is an important parameter which could be used for the assessment of the ecosystem condition in the urban areas. An integrated index of spatial structure is proposed which incorporates built types and land cover from the Local Climate Zones ({LCZ}) concept with urban ecosystems' classes developed on the basis of {MAES} typology. An algorithm has been developed for index generation using an urban ecosystems' database and remote sensing data. The index is used to define vegetation cover in urban ecosystems and assess their condition as a part of the assessment framework. It is also applied in the assessment of several ecosystem services through quantification of ecosystem services' indicators or as an indicator in a complex assessment. The results show that, although most urban ecosystems in Bulgaria are assessed as moderate and good condition, very few of them have very good condition and about 3.5\% have very bad condition. The highest scores are defined for urban green areas while the lowest are for transport networks. The use of an integrated index in urban ecosystem services' assessment is represented by examples for global and local climate regulation. The results are used to develop maps of ecosystem services supply capacity for selected cities. The overall analysis indicates that the urban ecosystems in Bulgaria have a moderate to good capacity for local climate regulation and moderate to low capacity for global climate regulation. The integrated index of spatial structure provides an appropriate basis for characterisation and assessment of the urban ecosystems condition and ecosystem services following the requirements of the {EU} Biodiversity Strategy and the {MAES} process. The proposed approach enables the internal heterogeneity of the urban ecosystems at national level to be defined, this being one of the main challenges in studying urban ecological systems. © Nedkov S et al.},

	abstract = {Pollinating insects are an integral part of cities' natural capital and perform an important ecosystem function with a high degree of relevance to many cultural ecosystem services. Consequently, pollinators serve as a useful proxy for assessing urban biodiversity. Beekeeping has recently emerged as a popular activity in many urban areas and a good deal of the motivation for urban beekeeping for many stems from the cultural and nonconsumptive aspects of beekeeping. Yet the recent increases in domestic honeybee densities in urban landscapes has raised concern regarding the potential threat that honeybees might pose to local populations of threatened bumblebee and solitary bee species. This issue constitutes a trade-off between the cultural ecosystem services associated with urban beekeeping and the regulation and maintenance ecosystem services of maintaining nursery populations of rare and threatened species. Municipal authorities in Oslo, Norway have proposed establishing eight “precautionary zones”, within which placement of honeybee hives could be more strictly regulated. We propose a mapping and assessment approach for informing zoning decisions regarding urban honeybees, utilising a model of an urban landscape's biophysical capacity to support pollinating insects ({ESTIMAP}). Together with an additional model describing the approximate distrubtion of honeybees in Oslo, we identify areas in the city where domestic honeybees may be more likely to exhaust floral resources. This case also tests the policy relevance of ecosystem service mapping tools beyond awareness raising, with broader general lessons for ecosystem mapping and assessment. © Stange E et al.},

	abstract = {The control of air quality in urban areas is drawing attention, as it generates significant benefits. Land use planning directly affects Ecosystem Services, particularly on air quality. Nonetheless, scientific knowledge of the effects derived by Land Use Changes on air quality is inadequate for planning proposals. This paper proposes an analytical application in the metropolitan area of Milan (North-west of Italy), one of the highly air-polluted areas of Europe. A spatial-based methodology to predict Particulate Matter concentration is tested using the regional emission inventory as a benchmark. The paper assumes that different dynamics cause of air pollution: (i) atmospheric emissions due to different kinds of land use sources; (ii) the rebound/resuspension of particles caused by the impervious degree of soil, and (iii) the absorption through green areas and trees. The methodological innovations introduced by this paper are related to (i) the small gridded distribution of values, and (ii) the emissions dynamics mix up with those on resuspension and absorption. This study experiments the upgrade of the existent Land Use Regression approach for Particulate Matters prediction and establishes a new methodology with a newer set of inputs.

The Kernel Density Estimation technique was applied to calculate continuous intensity indicators associated with urbanization, agriculture, and natural elements, considered as key components of the gradient. The potential {ES} demand and supply within each landscape area were assessed using expert–knowledge based indices associated to the {LULC} {CORINE} classes. Results showed a complex organization of “pillar” and transitional landscapes along the gradient, which match different bundles of {ES} demand and supply. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.},

	abstract = {The ecosystem services approach provides an efficient way to support urban green infrastructure planning. Such an assessment, together with mapping, can effectively produce spatial analyses on a specific scale, helping to maintain multi-functional landscapes and plan urban green infrastructure. In turn, green infrastructure can offer a wide variety of ecosystem services, promoting landscape sustainability. This study develops a methodology for the planning of urban green infrastructure based on an ecosystem services approach that assesses the supply capacity of ecosystem services, and identifies possible spatial characteristic areas for interlinking urban green infrastructure within the study area. More specifically, from a landscape perspective, we use 32 ecosystem services (as X-axis) and different land use types (as Y-axis) to build an ecosystem service assessment matrix. We then take the municipality of Barcelona as an example, using the latter to assess and map ecosystem services within the city through {ArcGIS}, which shows the spatial distribution characteristics of ecosystem services provision. We identify possible spatial areas - which include ecosystem services provision, barren, and obstructed areas - by overlapping the ecosystem services assessment maps. Ultimately, the results provide a reference for urban green infrastructure planning by recognizing priority protected areas, new construction areas, potential areas, and renewal areas. © 2019},

	doi = {10.3389/fenvs.2019.00093},
	abstract = {In urban areas, estimating the effect of land cover ({LC}) data spatial resolution on ecosystem services ({ES}) mapping remains a challenge. In particular, mapping spatial flows of {ES}, from greenspaces to beneficiaries, may be more sensitive to {LC} data resolution than mapping potential supply or demand separately. Our objectives were to compare the sensitivity of global- and local-flow {ES} maps to {LC} data resolution, and to assess the effect of {LC} data resolution within different types of urban land uses. A case study was conducted in the city of Laval, Canada. Carbon storage (a global-flow {ES}), urban cooling and pollination (two local-flow {ES}) were mapped using {LC} data aggregated from 1 to 15 m. Results were analyzed for districts (comprising various types of urban land uses), and for 480 × 480m residential and commercial zones. Greenspace cover was generally underestimated at coarser spatial resolutions; as a result, so were {ES} potential supply and flow. For urban cooling and pollination, the effect of {LC} data spatial resolution on {ES} flow also depended on changes in the spatial configuration of {ES} potential supply relative to {ES} demand. The magnitude of the effect differed among land use types. However, the effect was also highly variable between similar landscapes, suggesting that it is very sensitive to {LC} structure. To adequately map the {ES} provided by the small greenspaces scattered throughout the urban matrix, using land cover data with a spatial resolution of 5m or finer is recommended, especially for local-flow {ES}. © 2019 Rioux, Cimon-Morin, Pellerin, Alard and Poulin.},

	abstract = {Recent scientific developments are advancing to link land use and land cover ({LULC}) change with ecosystem service ({ES}) potentials. Such links within peri-urban ecosystems are scanty due to methodological and expertise challenge, and data limitation. The study applies the `{ES} matrix approach' to spatially display potentials for regulating {ES} in mainly overlooked data-scarce peri-urban areas, whereby {LULC} classes and qualitative {ES} values are the main data inputs. The {LULC} maps are based on {LANDSAT} satellite images from the years 1990, 2000 and 2010. {ES} potentials were assessed qualitatively on a relative scale ranging between 0 and 5 by use of interview data from local people. Results show that with exception of settlements, the area for all {LULC} classes decreased between 1990 and 2010. The `matrix approach' successfully generated {ES} potential maps for the different {LULC} classes. Grasslands, forests and wetlands have comparatively high potentials for regulating {ES}, whereas settlements and `otherlands' showed lower potentials. The main uncertainties of the study relate to study area selection, data accuracy and reliability, and `matrix approach' adaptability. Results indicate that the potential of the area to provide regulating {ES} is declining over time. To realize suitable and reliable results, it is necessary to conduct data accuracy-check during and after the fieldwork exercise. © 2018, © 2018 The Author(s).

This data is used to calculate the energy efficiency of each setup type and compare the economic viability of all, hence suggesting the best option.

The {EU} Biodiversity Strategy to 2020 requires the member states to map and assess the state of ecosystems and their services. Urban landscapes provide various services and their mapping necessitates prioritization, integration of data and application of geospatial approaches. In this paper, we focus on the geospatial approach used to assess and quantify the ecosystem services provided by the urban ecosystems and its possibilities for producing maps at multiple scales. The assessment of ecosystem services is based on various indicators, which rely on different data sources with their own origins, scales, and levels of precision. We develop seven {GIS}-based approaches that comprise different procedures and tools to arrange the available data and produce {ES} maps. The assessment is applied to 20 ecosystem services defined as relevant to the urban ecosystems in the country. We produced maps at multiple scales for selected individual services.

However, there is little attention for the accuracy of these maps. We made a systematic review and quantitative comparison of ecosystem service maps on the European scale to generate insights in the uncertainty of ecosystem service maps and discuss the possibilities for quantitative validation. Maps of climate regulation and recreation were reasonably similar while large uncertainties among maps of erosion protection and flood regulation were observed. Pollination maps had a moderate similarity. Differences among the maps were caused by differences in indicator definition, level of process understanding, mapping aim, data sources and methodology. Absence of suitable observed data on ecosystem services provisioning hampers independent validation of the maps. Consequently, there are, so far, no accurate measures for ecosystem service map quality. Policy makers and other users need to be cautious when applying ecosystem service maps for decision-making. The results illustrate the need for better process understanding and data acquisition to advance ecosystem service mapping, modelling and validation.},

Employing the ecosystem service concept is intended to support the development of policies and instruments that integrate social, economic and ecological perspectives. In recent years, this concept has become the paradigm of ecosystem management. 2. The prolific use of the term `ecosystem services' in scientific studies has given rise to concerns about its arbitrary application. A quantitative review of recent literature shows the diversity of approaches and uncovers a lack of consistent methodology. 3. From this analysis, we have derived four facets that characterise the holistic ideal of ecosystem services research: (i) biophysical realism of ecosystem data and models; (ii) consideration of local trade-offs; (iii) recognition of off-site effects; and (iv) comprehensive but critical involvement of stakeholders within assessment studies. 4. These four facets should be taken as a methodological blueprint for further development and discussion. They should critically reveal and elucidate what may often appear to be ad-hoc approaches to ecosystem service assessments. 5. Synthesis and applications: Based on this quantitative review, we provide guidelines for further development and discussions supporting consistency in applications of the ecosystem service concept as well as the credibility of results, which in turn can make it easier to generalise from the numerous individual studies.},

	abstract = {{ContextHumans} structure landscapes for the production of food, fibre and fuel, commonly resulting in declines of non-provisioning ecosystem services ({ESs}). Heterogeneous landscapes are capable of providing multiple {ESs}, and landscape configuration—spatial arrangement of land cover in the landscape—is expected to affect {ES} capacity. However, the majority of {ES} mapping studies have not accounted for landscape configuration.{ObjectivesOur} objective is to assess and quantify the relevance of configuration for mapping {ES} capacity. A review of empirical evidence for configuration effects on the capacity of ten {ESs} reveals that for four {ESs} configuration is relevant but typically ignored in {ES} quantification. For four {ESs} we quantify the relevance of configuration for mapping {ESs} using Scotland as a case study.{MethodsEach} {ES} was quantified through modelling, respectively ignoring or accounting for configuration. The difference in {ES} capacity between the two {ES} models was determined at multiple spatial scales.{ResultsConfiguration} affected the capacity of all four {ESs} mapped, particularly at the cell and watershed scale. At the scale of Scotland most local effects averaged out. Flood control and sediment retention responded strongest to configuration. {ESs} were affected by different aspects of configuration, thus requiring specific methods for mapping each {ES}.{ConclusionsAccounting} for configuration is important for the assessment of certain {ESs} at the cell and watershed scale. Incorporating configuration in landscape management provides opportunities for spatial optimization of {ES} capacity, but the diverging response of {ESs} to configuration suggests that accounting for configuration involves trade-offs between {ESs}.},

À partir d'une base de données spatialisée extrêmement précise, nous avons appliqué ou adapté des modèles permettant de cartographier 15 {SE}. Les résultats montrent que selon l'implication de la base de données d'{OS}/{US} en entrée dans les modèles, le type de modèle choisi (proxy vs. processus) et les processus modélisés, les patrons spatiaux résultants sont plus ou moins dépendants de la carte d'{OS}/{US} d'entrée. L'analyse critique des limites et incertitudes inhérentes à la constitution des cartes d'{OS}/{US} (en général et la notre en particulier), ainsi que l'utilisation de ces cartes à des fins de modélisation de {SE} a montré : 1- les apports notamment dans les milieux agricoles d'une description précise des dynamiques interannuelles de l'{OS}/{US} pour la quantification de {SE} d'approvisionnement ; 2- l'implication de limites typologiques d'{OS}/{US} pour la quantification de {SE}, notamment dans notre travail pour les milieux forestiers et semi-naturels.

It is framed by a broad set of key policy questions and structured around a conceptual framework that links human societies and their well-being with the environment. Next, this framework is tested through four thematic pilot studies, including stakeholders and experts working at different scales and governance levels, which contributed indicators to assess the state of ecosystem services. Indicators were scored according to different criteria and assorted per ecosystem type and ecosystem services using the common international classification of ecosystem services ({CICES}) as typology. We concluded that there is potential to develop a first {EU} wide ecosystem assessment on the basis of existing data if they are combined in a creative way.

In each case, a unique typology of land cover and aquatic resources was developed and relevant economic valuation studies were queried in order to assign estimates of ecosystem service values to each category in the typology. The result was a set of unique standardized ecosystem service value coefficients broken down by land cover class and service type for each case study. {GIS} analysis was then used to map the spatial distribution of each cover class at each study site. Economic values were summarized and mapped by tributary basin for Massachusetts and California and by property parcel for Maury Island. For Maury Island, changes in ecosystem service value flows were estimated under two alternative development scenarios. Drawing on lessons learned during the implementation of the case studies, the authors present some of the practical challenges that accompany spatially explicit ecosystem service value transfer.

	abstract = {We present a {GIS} method to interpret qualitatively expressed socio-economic scenarios in quantitative map-based terms. (i) We built scenarios using local stakeholders and experts to define how major land cover classes may change under different sets of drivers; (ii) we formalized these as spatially explicit rules, for example agriculture can only occur on certain soil types; (iii) we created a future land cover map which can then be used to model ecosystem services. We illustrate this for carbon storage in the Eastern Arc Mountains of Tanzania using two scenarios: the first based on sustainable development, the second based on 'business as usual' with continued forest-woodland degradation and poor protection of existing forest reserves. Between 2000 and 2025 4\% of carbon stocks were lost under the first scenario compared to a loss of 41\% of carbon stocks under the second scenario. Quantifying the impacts of differing future scenarios using the method we document here will be important if payments for ecosystem services are to be used to change policy in order to maintain critical ecosystem services.},

The relationship and spatial congruence between services were assessed. The congruence between primary production and these five services was tested to evaluate its value as a surrogate or proxy ecosystem service measure. This study illustrates that (1) most of South Africa's land surface is important for supplying at least one service, (2) there are low levels of congruence between the service ranges and even lower levels between the hotspots for different ecosystem services, and (3) primary production appears to show some potential as a surrogate for ecosystem service distribution.

	doi = {10.1016/j.ecolecon.2008.12.001},
	abstract = {A {GIS}-based approach was designed to spatially estimate direct use value of ecosystem services and to map results for a case study at county scale. The approach highlights the use of {GIS} to collect data, perform spatial analysis, and map economic values of ecosystem services. Three key steps of spatial valuation for agricultural products, forest products, and tourism services were illustrated in the {GIS}-based technical framework. We applied this approach to the Tiantai County (1423.8Â km2) in Zhejiang province of southeast China. Selected components of natural products and tourism services in the case area were mapped as data layers in {GIS}, with each layer containing monetary values for every 25Â m cell. The total direct use value of ecosystem services was estimated in {RMB} to be approximately 538Â million Yuan in 2005 (Chinese currency, 8.2Â {YuanÂ} =Â {US}\$1), of which agricultural products, forest products and tourism services accounted for 65\%, 30\% and 5\%, respectively. The critical areas for management purpose were identified depending on the heterogeneity of direct use services learned from the case study. The spatially explicit measures provide a mechanism for incorporating spatial context into ecosystem services evaluation. Based on the present {GIS}-based approach and case study, the suggestions and implications for local resources protection and eco-environmental management were extensively discussed. The work was expected to highlight research avenues to advance the ecosystem services framework as an operational basis for regional ecosystem-based management.},

The framework was applied to the Gelderse Vallei, a transitional rural area in the Netherlands. We successfully mapped and quantified the capacities to provide goods and services of eight landscape functions (residential, intensive livestock, drinking water, cultural heritage, tourism, plant habitat, arable production, and leisure cycling function) for this region. These function maps provide policy makers valuable information on regional qualities in terms of landscape functionality. Making landscape functions spatial explicit, adds an important component to research conducted in the field of quantification of landscape goods and services.},

This is a pre-requisite for a sustainable development with a balance between ecological, social and economic values. We analyse ecosystem services in areas of the urban fringe of Copenhagen, where the services provided are mainly related to human perception. We employ relatively simple methods in selected landscapes to qualify or quantify the aesthetics and recreational value, and the scale of the welfare economic value of these ecosystem services. In the first case area, the Danish state acquired 50 villas covering more than 50 ha in order to recreate open vistas and gain access for the public to the seaside. In the second case area, peri-urban open landscapes were protected by conservation orders, to maintain and enhance the benefits of green space for the growing urban population. We assess the value – in a broad sense – of these ecosystem services using three practical methods: a landscape evaluation in terms of services and qualities, an assessment of actual recreational use, and finally an assessment of the costs – in terms of residential development values lost – of securing the provision of aesthetic qualities and recreational opportunities.},

This suggests that at any given density, there is substantial scope for maximising ecological performance. The social status of residents was related to measures of tree cover. Housing type was significantly associated with some types of ecosystem service provision, indicating that the type of development may be important independent of its density.

	abstract = {Peri-urban areas are often characterized by valuable natural environments that provide essential life-support functions and ecosystem services for urban residents. Global environmental change has raised concerns over how urbanization and land use and land cover change affect ecosystem services. This study applied systems ecology theory and ecological energetic analysis to value the worth of natural environment and ecosystem services to a socioeconomic system. We begin with a general discussion of peri-urban areas and their ecosystem services. An emergy approach is applied to establish a framework for evaluating the ecosystem services by identifying systemic roles of each system components. The two-part framework includes: (1) an emergy evaluation of energetic flows of ecosystem services; and (2) an impact matrix to analyze systemic roles of services in the analyzed system. On the basis of the proposed valuation framework and land cover types in the greater Taipei area, this study analyzed ten ecosystems to determine how they interact, via energy flows, to contribute services to human society. By converting all stocks and flows into common emergy units, an impact matrix is constructed to analyze the systemic role of ecosystem components by classifying their status of being active, reactive, critical or indifferent. The analytical results indicate that the soil component of forest ecosystems, upstream rivers and agricultural productivity play critical role of ecosystem services in the study region. The effect of land cover change during 1971–2006 in the study region on ecosystem services is also analyzed. Finally, the implications of biophysical valuation of ecosystem service for spatial planning as related to adapting to global environmental change are discussed.},

	doi = {10.1111/1365-2664.12469},
	abstract = {The urban dimension of ecosystem services ({ES}) is underexposed, while the importance of {ES} for human wellbeing is nowhere as evident as in cities. Urban challenges such as air pollution, noise, and heat can be moderated by urban green space ({UGS}), simultaneously providing multiple other services. However, available methods to quantify {ES} cannot typically deal with the high spatial and thematic resolution land cover data that is needed to better understand {ES} supply in the urban context.This study derives methods to quantify and map a bundle of six {ES} as supplied by {UGS}, using land cover data with high spatial and thematic resolution, and applies these to the city of Rotterdam, the Netherlands. Land cover data comprise eight classes of {UGS}. Methods are derived from an evidence base on the importance of {UGS} types for the supply of each of the six {ES} that was built using literature review.The evidence base reveals that {UGS} types differ in their contribution to various {ES}, although the strength of the evidence varies. However, existing indicators for urban {ES} often do not discriminate between {UGS} types. To derive {UGS}-specific indicators, we combined methods and evidence from different research contexts ({ES}, non-{ES}, urban, non-urban).Rotterdam shows high spatial variation in the amount of {UGS} present, and accounting for this in {ES} supply reveals that {ES} bundles depend on {UGS} composition and configuration. While the contribution of {UGS} types to {ES} supply differed markedly with {UGS} type and {ES} considered, we demonstrate that synergies rather than trade-offs exist among the {ES} analysed.Synthesis and applications. Our findings underline the importance of a careful design of urban green space ({UGS}) in city planning for ecosystem services ({ES}) provision. Based on the latest insights on how different {UGS} provide {ES}, the methods presented in this study enable a more detailed quantification and mapping of the supply of {ES} in cities, allowing assessments of current supply of key urban {ES} and alternative urban designs. Such knowledge is indispensable in the quest for designing healthier and climate-resilient cities.This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.envsci.2015.07.009},
	abstract = {Identifying, promoting and preserving a strategically planned green infrastructure ({GI}) network can provide ecological, economic and social benefits. It has also become a priority for the planning and decision-making process in sectors such as conservation, (land) resource efficiency, agriculture, forestry or urban development.In this paper we propose a methodology that can be used to identify and map {GI} elements at landscape level based on the notions of ecological connectivity, multi-functionality of ecosystems and maximisation of benefits both for humans and for natural conservation. Our approach implies, first, the quantification and mapping of the natural capacity to deliver ecosystem services and, secondly, the identification of core habitats and wildlife corridors for biota. All this information is integrated and finally classified in a two-level {GI} network. The methodology is replicable and flexible (it can be tailored to the objectives and priorities of the practitioners); and it can be used at different spatial scales for research, planning or policy implementation.The method is applied in a continental scale analysis covering the {EU}-27 territory, taking into account the delivery of eight regulating and maintenance ecosystem services and the requirements of large mammals' populations. The best performing areas for ecosystem services and/or natural habitat provision cover 23\% of Europe and are classified as the core {GI} network. Another 16\% of the study area with relatively good ecological performance is classified as the subsidiary {GI} network. There are large differences in the coverage of the {GI} network among countries ranging from 73\% of the territory in Estonia to 6\% in Cyprus. A potential application of these results is the implementation of the {EU} Biodiversity Strategy, assuming that the core {GI} network might be crucial to maintain biodiversity and natural capital and, thus, should be conserved; while the subsidiary network could be restored to increase both the ecological and social resilience. This kind of {GI} analysis could be also included in the negotiations of the European Regional Development Funds or the Rural Development Programmes. © 2015 The Authors.},

	abstract = {We present an approach to identify and map social-ecological systems based on the direct use of ecosystem services by households. This approach builds on the premise that characteristic bundles of ecosystem service use represent integrated expressions of different underlying social-ecological systems. We test the approach in South Africa using national census data on the direct use of six provisioning services (freshwater from a natural source, firewood for cooking, firewood for heating, natural building materials, animal production, and crop production) at two different scales. Based on a cluster analysis, we identify three distinct ecosystem service bundles that represent social-ecological systems characterized by low, medium and high levels of direct ecosystem service use among households. We argue that these correspond to 'green-loop', 'transition' and 'red-loop' systems as defined by Cumming et al. (2014). When mapped, these systems form coherent spatial units that differ from systems identified by additive combinations of separate social and biophysical datasets, the most common method of mapping social-ecological systems to date. The distribution of the systems we identified is mainly determined by social factors, such as household income, gender of the household head, and land tenure, and only partly determined by the supply of natural resources. An understanding of the location and characteristic resource use dynamics of different social-ecological systems allows for policies to be better targeted at the particular sustainability challenges faced in different areas. © 2015 Z.},

	abstract = {The economic value of ecosystem services (non-market) and the market value (represented by a proxy of gross domestic product ({GDP})) represent the synthetic green {GDP} of the earth and of different nations. Mapping and estimating national green {GDPs} is a challenging task. In this study, we estimated the global market and non-market monetary values using two images, {GlobCover} 2009 and nighttime satellite imagery, as well as a comprehensive dataset. We also developed an integrated method supported by geographic information system ({GIS}) techniques, focused on spatial heterogeneity and real value, to create synthetic green {GDP} maps at global and national scales. Our results show that in 2009, for the entire biosphere, the ecosystem services value ({ESV}) could be estimated at {US}\$ 149.61 trillion. Approximately 75.15\% of the {ESV} is contributed by marine systems. The world {GDP} in 2009 was about {US}\$ 71.75 trillion (for 225 countries or regions), resulting in a ratio of total {ESV} to {GDP} of approximately 2.09-1. Nighttime satellite imagery represents a more spatially explicit indicator of market value than does {GDP}. We also found that the distribution of the synthetic national green {GDPs} follows Zipf's Law, which holds that internal coherence exists among countries. A crude but simple indicator of the \%{ESV} indicates that the relationship between the {GDP} and {ESV} is not always in a fixed pattern. The reliability of this result was demonstrated by comparing it with previous research and other relevant indices. We found a very high degree of confidence associated with this product. The method presented here is generally applicable at the global and continental scales and is applicable at the national scale for mapping the {ESV} and {GDP}. We hope that the results of this study will inform both policy-makers and the public about national green {GDPs} and encourage them to incorporate these values into policy decisions. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {Urban ecosystem services ({ESs}) can moderate many common environmental issues in cities that are caused by the land use transformation central to urbanization. However, quantitative knowledge of historical changes in {ES} provisioning at various urban scales is limited. In this research, it is proposed to identify {ESs}, especially those generated by urban green space ({UGS}), and quantify their spatiotemporal variations at the regional scale in the southern part of Seoul City, Korea. Changes are first detected in landscape patterns, then one {ES} indicator - carbon sequestration ({CS}) - is chosen as a test case, and its spatial pattern explored using the Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs ({InVEST}) model. Total potential {CS} decreased by 41.2\% from 1975 to 2015, with loss and fragmentation of landscapes occurring and patches becoming smaller and simpler in shape in the urban area, as indicated by landscape metrics. Moreover, strong decreases in urban forest and agricultural areas were the primary causes of loss of {CS}. On the other hand, a 120\% increase in the grassland area somewhat offset these two factors. It is hoped that these results will contribute to cognizance of the potential of historical processes to inform future policy decisions related to green infrastructure and land-use planning. © {SPSD} Press from 2010, {SPSD} Press, Kanazawa.},

	doi = {10.3390/s19204357},
	abstract = {There are many sensor fusion frameworks proposed in the literature using different sensors and fusion methods combinations and configurations. More focus has been on improving the accuracy performance; however, the implementation feasibility of these frameworks in an autonomous vehicle is less explored. Some fusion architectures can perform very well in lab conditions using powerful computational resources; however, in real-world applications, they cannot be implemented in an embedded edge computer due to their high cost and computational need. We propose a new hybrid multi-sensor fusion pipeline configuration that performs environment perception for autonomous vehicles such as road segmentation, obstacle detection, and tracking. This fusion framework uses a proposed encoder-decoder based Fully Convolutional Neural Network ({FCNx}) and a traditional Extended Kalman Filter ({EKF}) nonlinear state estimator method. It also uses a configuration of camera, {LiDAR}, and radar sensors that are best suited for each fusion method. The goal of this hybrid framework is to provide a cost-effective, lightweight, modular, and robust (in case of a sensor failure) fusion system solution. It uses {FCNx} algorithm that improve road detection accuracy compared to benchmark models while maintaining real-time efficiency that can be used in an autonomous vehicle embedded computer. Tested on over 3K road scenes, our fusion algorithm shows better performance in various environment scenarios compared to baseline benchmark networks. Moreover, the algorithm is implemented in a vehicle and tested using actual sensor data collected from a vehicle, performing real-time environment perception.},

In this paper, after analyzing different road features and road models, the road extraction methods were classified into the classification-based methods, knowledge-based methods, mathematical morphology, active contour model, and dynamic programming. Firstly, the road features, road model, existing difficulties and interference factors for road extraction were analyzed. Secondly, the principle of road extraction, the advantages and disadvantages of various methods and research achievements were briefly highighted. Then, the comparisons of the different road extraction algorithms were performed, including road features, test samples and shortcomings. Finally, the research results in recent years were summarized emphatically. It is obvious that only using one kind of road features is hard to get an excellent extraction effect. Hence, in order to get good results, the road extraction should combine multiple methods according to the real applications. In the future, how to realize the complete road extraction from a {RS} image is still an essential but challenging and important research topic.},

The results have the premise to be applied for evaluating different maintenance strategies using safety as a performance measure. As part of this approach, this research introduces a road surface condition index as a surrogate measure of the commonly used friction measure to capture different road surface conditions. Data from various data sources, such as weather, road condition observations, traffic counts and accidents, are integrated and used to test three event-based models including the Negative Binomial model, the generalized {NB} model and the zero inflated {NB} model. These models are compared for their capability to explain differences in accident frequencies between individual snow storms. It was found that the generalized {NB} model best fits the data, and is most capable of capturing heterogeneity other than excess zeros. Among the main results, it was found that the road surface condition index was statistically significant influencing the accident occurrence. This research is the first showing the empirical relationship between safety and road surface conditions at a disaggregate level (event-based), making it feasible to quantify the safety benefits of alternative maintenance goals and methods.},

The composed hardware to measure weather are microprocessor, temperature sensor, humidity sensor, atmospheric pressure sensor, precipitation sensor, {LTE} modem, solar cell panel and its controller, and battery. In addition to, there are software for forecasting freezing located in a specific area where devices to detect data such as temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, and road temperature are installed for the purpose of not only transmitting their data but also data storage through wireless internet modem. Real-time monitoring and an algorithm for forecasting freezing make it possible to predict freezing by utilizing the accumulated data. Freezing on road can be occurred according to bigger humidity, big difference of humidity as well as of atmospheric pressure. The measurement of atmospheric temperature as well as road temperature, atmospheric pressure and humidity is conducted by the proposed system in this study. The relationship between a changing weather data in the past winter seasons during from 15th November to 31th March and the amount of precipitation included a snowfall is grasped to digitize. Present weather information is applied by not only detecting the phenomenon to show changing at constant humidity, atmospheric pressure, and temperature but also calculating a precipitation probability in case of this reiteration phenomenon or particularly higher humidity as well as particularly lower atmospheric pressure to grasp of relations with precipitation. The proposed system is composed up four steps such as good, concern, caution, and warning through forecasting freezing time from 3 hours ago. Therefore, it is possible not only to forecast freezing hazard up to 70\% due to frozen rain but also to use snow-removing work prepared in advance as well as weather information aids by forecasting freezing. © {BEIESP}.},

In the automotive sector, the term vehicle active safety systems refers to those whose goal is to help avoid a crash or to reduce the risk of having an accident. These systems safeguard us, being in continuous evolution and incorporating new capabilities continuously. In order for these systems and vehicles to work adequately, they need to know some fundamental information: the road condition on which the vehicle is circulating. This early road detection is intended to allow vehicle control systems to act faster and more suitably, thus obtaining a substantial advantage. In this work, we try to detect the road condition the vehicle is being driven on, using the standard sensors installed in commercial vehicles. Vehicle models were programmed in on-board systems to perform real-time estimations of the forces of contact between the wheel and road and the speed of the vehicle. Subsequently, a fuzzy logic block is used to obtain an index representing the road condition. Finally, an artificial neural network was used to provide the optimal slip for each surface.

Many previous achievements lighten the network by reducing layers, channels and applying group convolution, depthwise convolution to get real-time performance.

	doi = {10.1007/978-3-030-17795-9_14},
	abstract = {Automated interpretation and understanding of the driving environment using image processing is a challenging task, as most current vision-based systems are not designed to work in dynamically-changing and naturalistic real-world settings. For instance, road weather condition classification using a camera is a challenge due to high variance in weather, road layout, and illumination conditions. Most transportation agencies, within the U.S., have deployed some cameras for operational awareness. Given that weather related crashes constitute 22\% of all vehicle crashes and 16\% of crash fatalities, this study proposes using these same cameras as a source for estimating roadway surface condition. The developed model is focused on three road surface conditions resulting from weather including: Clear (clear/dry), Rainy-Wet (rainy/slushy/wet), and Snow (snow-covered/partially snow-covered).

	doi = {10.14135/j.cnki.1006-3080.20180119001},
	abstract = {Nowadays, automatic driving and assisted driving techniques have been receiving more and more attentions. Due to the limitation of visible light sensor at night, it is difficult for vehicles to automatically observe the road conditions and correctly understand the driving environment. To address these problems, this paper proposes a method to segment night scene semantically by combining the visible and infrared thermal images' information. Firstly, the dual-band images are input into the parallel fully convolutional network, and the semantic segmentation is realized effectively by combing the two-way network's information at the end of the network. Besides, we implement adaptive histogram equalization and bilateral filtering on the dual-band images and improve the final segmentation result by a dense condition random field. In order to verify the proposed algorithm, we collect and annotate 541 pairs of visible and infrared thermal images in urban road sence, and 200 pairs of visible and infrared thermal images in campus road scene via {KAIST} all-day visual place recognition database. Experiment results show that the semantic segmentation method based on visible image may be infected by headlights and has a relatively low segmentation accuracy on persons and cars. The method based on thermal infarad image is good at segment heat source objects, but it cannot recognize the objects via textures or colors. The method based on color fusion image considers the characteristics of visible and thermal infarad images and gets some improvement. Futhermore, parallel fully convolutional network can more accurately resolve the night road scene than using only visible images, infrared thermal images or fusion images. The image enhancement processing can further improve the optimization of densecondition random field on seriously under-lit road scene images. © 2019, Editorial Department of Journal of East China University of Science and Technology.

It has proven to be a dominant technology to carry out tasks such as image classification, semantic segmentation, and object detection. The convolution neural networks surpass the performance of the existing algorithms such as {SIFT}, {HOG}, etcetera. Where, instead of manually engineering the features, supervised learning help to learn the essential low-level and high-level features necessary for classifications. The convolution neural networks have become a popular tool to counter computer vision problems. However, it is computationally, and memory intensive to train and deploy the network because of the model size of a deep convolution neural networks. However, the research in the field of design space exploration ({DSE}) of neural networks and compression techniques to develop compact architectures, have made convolution neural networks memory and computationally efficient. These techniques have also improved the feasibility of convolution neural network for deployment on embedded targets. The paper explores the concept of compact convolution filters to reduce the number of parameters in a convolution neural network. The intuition behind the approach is that replacing convolution filters with a stack of compact convolution filters helps in developing a compact architecture with competitive accuracy. This paper explores the fire module a compact convolution filter and proposes a method of recreating a state-of-the-art architecture {VGG}-16 using the fire modules to develop a compact architecture, which is further trained on the {CIFAR}-10 dataset and deployed on a real-time embedded platform known as Bluebox 2.0 by {NXP} using {RTMaps} software framework.},

	abstract = {Internet of Things ({IoT}) is an emerging technology where standalone equipments and autonomous devices are connected to each other and users via Internet. When {IoT} concept meets agriculture, the future of farming is pushed to the next level, giving birth to what is called “Smart Agriculture” or “Precision Agriculture”. The most important benefit from {IoT} is that a user can daily monitor his crop online in a seamless fashion. High quality data gathered from various sensors and transferred wirelessly to farm database will increase farmers understanding to their landuse leading to increasing income and product quality. One of the monitoring process is weeds detection and crop yield estimation using camera sensors. The acquired images help farmers to build map of weeds distribution or yield quantity all over the field, these maps can be used either for real-time processing or to predetermine weeds regions based on field maps history of the previous seasons. This process is referred to as segmentation problem. Several algorithms have been proposed for that purpose, however, these algorithms were run only on high performance computers. In this paper, we evaluate performance and the robustness of the most used legacy algorithms under local conditions. We focused on implementing these schemes within real-time application constraint. For instance, these algorithms were implemented and run in a low-cost embedded system. © Springer International Publishing {AG} 2017.},

	doi = {10.1109/IVS.2018.8500598},
	abstract = {Multilane detection system is a vital prerequisite for realizing higher {ADAS} functionality of autonomous navigation. In this work, we present an efficient convolutional neural network ({CNN}) architecture for real time detection of multiple lane boundaries using a camera sensor. Our network has a simple encoder-decoder architecture and is a special two class semantic segmentation network designed to segment lane boundaries. Efficacy of our network stems from two key insights which are at the foundation of all our design decisions. Firstly, we term a lane boundary as a weak class object in the context of semantic segmentation. We show that the weak class objects which occupy relatively few pixels in the scene, also have a relatively low detection accuracy among the know segmentation methods. We present novel design choices and intuitions to improve the segmentation accuracy of weak class objects, which in turn reduces computation time. Our second insight lies in the manner we depict the ground truth information in our derived dataset. Instead of annotating just the visible lane markers, we accurately delineate the lane boundaries in the ground truth for challenging scenarios like occlusions, low light and degraded lane markings. We then leverage the {CNN}'s ability to concisely summarize the global and local context in an image, for accurately inferring lane boundaries in these challenging cases. We evaluate our network against {ENet} and {FCN}-8, and found it performing notably better in terms of speed and accuracy. Our network achieves an encouraging 46 {FPS} performance on {NVIDIA} Drive {PX}2 platform and it has been validated on our test vehicle in highway driving conditions. © 2018 {IEEE}.},

In this work, we propose {MAVNet}: a small, light-weight, deep neural network for real-time semantic segmentation on micro Aerial Vehicles ({MAVs}). {MAVNet}, inspired by {ERFNet} [1], features 400 times fewer parameters and achieves comparable performance with some reference models in empirical experiments. Our model achieves a trade-off between speed and accuracy, achieving up to 48 {FPS} on an {NVIDIA} 1080Ti and 9 {FPS} on the {NVIDIA} Jetson Xavier when processing high resolution imagery. Additionally, we provide two novel datasets that represent challenges in semantic segmentation for real-time {MAV} tracking and infrastructure inspection tasks and verify {MAVNet} on these datasets. Our algorithm and datasets are made publicly available.},

	title = {In Defense of Pre-Trained {ImageNet} Architectures for Real-Time Semantic Segmentation of Road-Driving Images},
	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.08469},
	abstract = {Recent success of semantic segmentation approaches on demanding road driving datasets has spurred interest in many related application fields. Many of these applications involve real-time prediction on mobile platforms such as cars, drones and various kinds of robots. Real-time setup is challenging due to extraordinary computational complexity involved. Many previous works address the challenge with custom lightweight architectures which decrease computational complexity by reducing depth, width and layer capacity with respect to general purpose architectures. We propose an alternative approach which achieves a significantly better performance across a wide range of computing budgets. First, we rely on a light-weight general purpose architecture as the main recognition engine. Then, we leverage light-weight upsampling with lateral connections as the most cost-effective solution to restore the prediction resolution. Finally, we propose to enlarge the receptive field by fusing shared features at multiple resolutions in a novel fashion. Experiments on several road driving datasets show a substantial advantage of the proposed approach, either with {ImageNet} pre-trained parameters or when we learn from scratch. Our Cityscapes test submission entitled {SwiftNetRN}-18 delivers 75.5\% {MIoU} and achieves 39.9 Hz on 1024×2048 images on {GTX}1080Ti.},

While some of these models achieve state-of-the art results and super human level performance, deploying these models in a time critical robotic environment remains an ongoing challenge. Real-time frameworks are of paramount importance to build a robotic society where humans and robots integrate seamlessly. To this end, we present a novel real-time structure prediction framework that predicts depth at 30 frames per second on an {NVIDIA}-{TX}2. At the time of writing, this is the first piece of work to showcase such a capability on a mobile platform. We also demonstrate with extensive experiments that neural networks with very large model capacities can be leveraged in order to train accurate condensed model architectures in a “from teacher to student” style knowledge transfer.},

For mass-market deployment, the embedded solution is required to address the right cost and performance envelope along with security and safety. In the case of automated driving, one of the key functionality is 'finding drivable free space', which is addressed using deep learning techniques like {CNN}. These {CNN} networks pose huge computing requirements in terms of hundreds of {GOPS}/{TOPS} (Giga or Tera operations per second), which seems beyond the capability of today's embedded {SoC}. This paper covers various techniques consisting of fixed-point conversion, sparse multiplication, fusing of layers and network pruning, for tailoring on the embedded solution. These techniques are implemented on the device by means of optimized Deep learning library for inference. The paper concludes by demonstrating the results of a {CNN} network running in real time on {TI}'s {TDA}2X embedded platform producing a high-quality drivable space output for automated driving. © 2018 {IEEE}.},

Most of such systems are deployed on low computational embedded systems located in the vehicles or in remote gantry and roadside poles. While fully convolutional networks have been proved to be a powerful classifier being able to make inference on every single pixel of the input image, they entail high computational costs even for the inference process. In this paper, a vehicle windshield semantic segmentation is proposed utilizing a fast and compact encoder-decoder architecture of a fully convolutional network implemented in a low-power embedded system. The performed qualitative and quantitative performance measurements exemplify a real-time portable embedded solution which is competitive in terms of performance and inference time.},

	doi = {10.1109/AICCSA.2018.8612854},
	abstract = {In the context of video segmentation with depth sensor, prior work maps the Metropolis algorithm, a simulated annealing based key routine during segmentation, onto an Nvidia Graphics Processing Unit ({GPU}) and achieves real-time performance for 320×256 video sequences. However that work utilizes depth information in a very limited manner. This paper presents a new {GPU}-based method that expands the use of depth information during segmentation and shows the improved segmentation quality over the prior work. In particular, we discuss various ways to restructure the segmentation flow, and evaluate the impact of several design choices on throughput and quality. We introduce a scaling factor for amplifying the interaction strength between two spatially neighboring pixels and increasing the clarity of borderlines. This allows us to reduce the number of required Metropolis iterations by over 50\% with the drawback of over-segmentation. We evaluate two design choices to overcome this problem. First, we incorporate depth information into the perceived color difference calculations between two pixels, and show that the interaction strengths between neighboring pixels can be more accurately modeled by incorporating depth information. Second, we pre-process the frames with Bilateral filter instead of Gaussian filter, and show its effectiveness in terms of reducing the difference between similar colors. Both approaches help improve the quality of the segmentation, and the reduction in Metropolis iterations helps improve the throughout from 29 fps to 34 fps for 320×256 video sequences.},

We use a multiple model fitting approach where each object can move independently from the background and still be effectively tracked and its shape fused over time using only the information from pixels associated with that object label. Previous attempts to deal with dynamic scenes have typically considered moving regions as outliers, and consequently do not model their shape or track their motion over time. In contrast, we enable the robot to maintain 3D models for each of the segmented objects and to improve them over time through fusion. As a result, our system can enable a robot to maintain a scene description at the object level which has the potential to allow interactions with its working environment; even in the case of dynamic scenes.},

We show that convolutional networks by themselves, trained end-to-end, pixels-to-pixels, exceed the state-of-the-art in semantic segmentation. Our key insight is to build “fully convolutional” networks that take input of arbitrary size and produce correspondingly-sized output with efficient inference and learning. We define and detail the space of fully convolutional networks, explain their application to spatially dense prediction tasks, and draw connections to prior models. We adapt contemporary classification networks ({AlexNet} [20], the {VGG} net [31], and {GoogLeNet} [32]) into fully convolutional networks and transfer their learned representations by fine-tuning [3] to the segmentation task. We then define a skip architecture that combines semantic information from a deep, coarse layer with appearance information from a shallow, fine layer to produce accurate and detailed segmentations. Our fully convolutional network achieves state-of-the-art segmentation of {PASCAL} {VOC} (20\% relative improvement to 62.2\% mean {IU} on 2012), {NYUDv}2, and {SIFT} Flow, while inference takes less than one fifth of a second for a typical image.},

	abstract = {We present {YOLO}, a new approach to object detection. Prior work on object detection repurposes classifiers to perform detection. Instead, we frame object detection as a regression problem to spatially separated bounding boxes and associated class probabilities. A single neural network predicts bounding boxes and class probabilities directly from full images in one evaluation. Since the whole detection pipeline is a single network, it can be optimized end-to-end directly on detection performance. Our unified architecture is extremely fast. Our base {YOLO} model processes images in real-time at 45 frames per second. A smaller version of the network, Fast {YOLO}, processes an astounding 155 frames per second while still achieving double the {mAP} of other real-time detectors. Compared to state-of-the-art detection systems, {YOLO} makes more localization errors but is far less likely to predict false detections where nothing exists. Finally, {YOLO} learns very general representations of objects. It outperforms all other detection methods, including {DPM} and R-{CNN}, by a wide margin when generalizing from natural images to artwork on both the Picasso Dataset and the People-Art Dataset.},

It is perceived as an environmentally friendly way to travel, leading to benefits for health and traffic alleviation. This study examines the determinants of utility cycling behaviour and intent, and more broadly, active transportation (i.e. cycling and walking) behaviour in Edmonton, Canada – the northernmost North American city with a metropolitan population over one million. With harsh winter weather and low cycling rates, the city presents a unique case study for cycling behavior. In this research, we analyzed 646 responses to a bike ridership survey conducted in 2014 by the City of Edmonton. Borrowing concepts from behaviour theory, public health and transportation engineering we seek to quantify the effects of infrastructure density, traffic attitude, perceived control over time and distance, and traffic stress tolerance perception on cycling for utility purposes, the intention to cycle more frequently, and the use of an active mode of transportation, specifically for a northern and low-cycling city. Three empirical models were developed to describe cycling behaviour using binary logistic regression. Most variables were significant and in line with other study findings in the current literature. Results point at the importance of perceived safety in deciding or intending to cycle, as well as perceived time and distance of travel. Broad policy implications and suggestions for future research are discussed.},

On the {ImageNet} dataset we evaluate residual nets with a depth of up to 152 layers—8x deeper than {VGG} nets but still having lower complexity. An ensemble of these residual nets achieves 3.57\% error on the {ImageNet} test set. This result won the 1st place on the {ILSVRC} 2015 classification task. We also present analysis on {CIFAR}-10 with 100 and 1000 layers. The depth of representations is of central importance for many visual recognition tasks.

In this paper, we present a network and training strategy that relies on the strong use of data augmentation to use the available annotated samples more efficiently. The architecture consists of a contracting path to capture context and a symmetric expanding path that enables precise localization. We show that such a network can be trained end-to-end from very few images and outperforms the prior best method (a sliding-window convolutional network) on the {ISBI} challenge for segmentation of neuronal structures in electron microscopic stacks. Using the same network trained on transmitted light microscopy images (phase contrast and {DIC}) we won the {ISBI} cell tracking challenge 2015 in these categories by a large margin. Moreover, the network is fast. Segmentation of a 512x512 image takes less than a second on a recent {GPU}. The full implementation (based on Caffe) and the trained networks are available at http://lmb.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/people/ronneber/u-net .},

	abstract = {We present a deep learning framework for probabilistic pixel-wise semantic segmentation, which we term Bayesian {SegNet}. Semantic segmentation is an important tool for visual scene understanding and a meaningful measure of uncertainty is essential for decision making. Our contribution is a practical system which is able to predict pixel-wise class labels with a measure of model uncertainty. We achieve this by Monte Carlo sampling with dropout at test time to generate a posterior distribution of pixel class labels. In addition, we show that modelling uncertainty improves segmentation performance by 2-3\% across a number of state of the art architectures such as {SegNet}, {FCN} and Dilation Network, with no additional parametrisation. We also observe a significant improvement in performance for smaller datasets where modelling uncertainty is more effective. We benchmark Bayesian {SegNet} on the indoor {SUN} Scene Understanding and outdoor {CamVid} driving scenes datasets.},

	abstract = {We describe the participation of team {TakeLab} in the aggression detection shared task at the {TRAC}1 workshop for English. Aggression manifests in a variety of ways. Unlike some forms of aggression that are impossible to prevent in day-to-day life, aggressive speech abounding on social networks could in principle be prevented or at least reduced by simply disabling users that post aggressively worded messages. The first step in achieving this is to detect such messages. The task, however, is far from being trivial, as what is considered as aggressive speech can be quite subjective, and the task is further complicated by the noisy nature of user-generated text on social networks. Our system learns to distinguish between open aggression, covert aggression, and non-aggression in social media texts. We tried different machine learning approaches, including traditional (shallow) machine learning models, deep learning models, and a combination of both. We achieved respectable results, ranking 4th and 8th out of 31 submissions on the Facebook and Twitter test sets, respectively.},

	abstract = {Mapping key areas for ecosystem service ({ES}) supply is essential for the development of strategies that will ensure their future supply. Given the rapid development in this area of research, we performed a review of different approaches used to map {ES}, with a special focus on those that use social–ecological data. We used an analytical framework based on five criteria for analyzing and comparing the methodological approaches: the types of {ES}, availability of data sources, types of data sources, spatial scale, and methods used to model {ES}. We found that regulating services were the most commonly mapped, followed by provisioning, cultural, and supporting services. Secondary (readily available) data were used more frequently than primary data to map {ES}. Biophysical data (land-cover variables) and mixed sources (databases like global statistics) were the most commonly employed ones. Most studies were performed at the regional or at the national scale. The most commonly used method to model services was the development of models based on the well-known causal relationships between environmental variables, followed by the extrapolation of {ES} values from primary data to the total analyzed area frequently using land-cover maps. Our synthesis reveals that the majority of studies are based on secondary data, applied at broad scales, without validation techniques. There is an urgent need to develop methods for deepening our understanding of the social–ecological processes behind the supply of {ES} in order to improve our ability to map {ES} for decision making.},

	abstract = {Mapping the demand for ecosystem services ({ES}) has received increased attention in scientific research and is seen as a relevant tool to inform conservation planning, land use planning and management. Yet, there is a varying understanding of the concept of {ES} demand, which has implications on how and where {ES} demand is being mapped. In this paper we review the current conceptual understanding of {ES} demand, indicators to measure demand and the approaches used to quantify and map demand. We identified four distinct “demand types”, which relate to different ecosystem service categories. These demand types include demand expressed in terms of (1) risk reduction, (2) preferences and values, (3) direct use or (4) consumption of goods and services. Each of the demand types was linked to specific methods applied in the reviewed literature. We found that operationalization of {ES} demand in policy, planning and management requires a more consistent understanding and definition of {ES} demand, its drivers and its temporal dynamics. Furthermore, the impact of demands for multiple ecosystem services on land use change needs to be investigated. This will allow for the consideration of temporal and cross-level interactions between supply and demand of ecosystem services and its impacts in land use change modelling.},

	abstract = {This study aims at providing a new method to efficiently analyze detailed urban ecological conditions at the example of Shanghai, one of the world's most densely populated megacities. The main objective is to develop a method to effectively analyze high-resolution optical satellite data for mapping of ecologically important urban space and to evaluate ecological changes through the emerging ecosystem service supply and demand concept. Two {IKONOS} and {GeoEye}-1 scenes were used to determine land use/land cover change in Shanghai's urban core from 2000 to 2009. After preprocessing, the images were segmented and classified into seven distinct urban land use/land cover classes through {SVM}. The classes were then transformed into ecosystem service supply and demand budgets for regulating, provisioning and cultural services, and ecological integrity based on ecosystem functions. Decreases in continuous urban fabric and industrial areas in the favor of urban green sites and high-rise areas with commercial/residential function could be observed resulting in an increase of at least 20\% in service supply budgets. Main contributor to the change is the decrease in continuous urban fabric and industrial areas. The overall results and outcome of the study strengthen the suggested application of the proposed method for urban ecosystem service budget mapping with hitherto for that purpose unutilized high-resolution data. The insights and results from this study might further contribute to sustainable urban planning, prove common grounds for interurban comparisons, or aid in enhancing ecological intraurban functionality by analyzing the distribution of urban ecospace and lead to improved accessibility and proximity to ecosystem services in urban areas. © 2008-2012 {IEEE}.},

	abstract = {This study explores the use of ecosystem service ({ES}) knowledge to support urban planning in the assessment of future scenarios. The case study concerns the prioritszation of brownfield regeneration interventions in the city of Trento (Italy). Alternative planning scenarios considering the conversion of existing brownfields into new urban parks are assessed and compared. The assessment focuses on two {ES} of critical importance for the city, namely microclimate regulation and nature-based recreation. The benefits of the different scenarios are quantified based on the number of expected beneficiaries broken down into different vulnerability classes and then compared through a multi-criteria analysis. Three combinations of criteria and weights reflect different planning objectives and related decision-makers' orientations about what {ES} and beneficiary groups should be prioritised. The application demonstrates the potential for {ES} assessments to support urban planning processes in the specific phase of assessment and selection of alternatives, by meeting the requirements in terms of both sensitivity to small-scale changes in land uses or management activities and capacity to capture simultaneous variations in supply and demand of multiple {ES}. Being coherent with socially-orientated planning objectives, indicators based on {ES} demand and beneficiaries can effectively convey information about {ES} in planning decisions. Multi-criteria analysis is an effective way to integrate multiple {ES} assessments with other information about costs and benefits of planning scenarios, exploring diverse stakeholder perspectives and balancing competing objectives in a rational and transparent way. © Cortinovis C, Geneletti D.},

	doi = {10.3897/oneeco.2.e14499},
	abstract = {Urban ecosystems are the areas where built infrastructure covers a large proportion of the land surface but the main source of ecosystem services provision is the green infrastructure. This provision is very much dependent on the particular combination of green spaces such as parks or vegetation belts and paved areas such as buildings and streets. The spatial arrangement of these elements is an important parameter which could be used for the assessment of the ecosystem condition in the urban areas. An integrated index of spatial structure is proposed which incorporates built types and land cover from the Local Climate Zones ({LCZ}) concept with urban ecosystems' classes developed on the basis of {MAES} typology. An algorithm has been developed for index generation using an urban ecosystems' database and remote sensing data. The index is used to define vegetation cover in urban ecosystems and assess their condition as a part of the assessment framework. It is also applied in the assessment of several ecosystem services through quantification of ecosystem services' indicators or as an indicator in a complex assessment. The results show that, although most urban ecosystems in Bulgaria are assessed as moderate and good condition, very few of them have very good condition and about 3.5\% have very bad condition. The highest scores are defined for urban green areas while the lowest are for transport networks. The use of an integrated index in urban ecosystem services' assessment is represented by examples for global and local climate regulation. The results are used to develop maps of ecosystem services supply capacity for selected cities. The overall analysis indicates that the urban ecosystems in Bulgaria have a moderate to good capacity for local climate regulation and moderate to low capacity for global climate regulation. The integrated index of spatial structure provides an appropriate basis for characterisation and assessment of the urban ecosystems condition and ecosystem services following the requirements of the {EU} Biodiversity Strategy and the {MAES} process. The proposed approach enables the internal heterogeneity of the urban ecosystems at national level to be defined, this being one of the main challenges in studying urban ecological systems. © Nedkov S et al.},

	abstract = {Pollinating insects are an integral part of cities' natural capital and perform an important ecosystem function with a high degree of relevance to many cultural ecosystem services. Consequently, pollinators serve as a useful proxy for assessing urban biodiversity. Beekeeping has recently emerged as a popular activity in many urban areas and a good deal of the motivation for urban beekeeping for many stems from the cultural and nonconsumptive aspects of beekeeping. Yet the recent increases in domestic honeybee densities in urban landscapes has raised concern regarding the potential threat that honeybees might pose to local populations of threatened bumblebee and solitary bee species. This issue constitutes a trade-off between the cultural ecosystem services associated with urban beekeeping and the regulation and maintenance ecosystem services of maintaining nursery populations of rare and threatened species. Municipal authorities in Oslo, Norway have proposed establishing eight “precautionary zones”, within which placement of honeybee hives could be more strictly regulated. We propose a mapping and assessment approach for informing zoning decisions regarding urban honeybees, utilising a model of an urban landscape's biophysical capacity to support pollinating insects ({ESTIMAP}). Together with an additional model describing the approximate distrubtion of honeybees in Oslo, we identify areas in the city where domestic honeybees may be more likely to exhaust floral resources. This case also tests the policy relevance of ecosystem service mapping tools beyond awareness raising, with broader general lessons for ecosystem mapping and assessment. © Stange E et al.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.ecoser.2017.09.009},
	abstract = {The control of air quality in urban areas is drawing attention, as it generates significant benefits. Land use planning directly affects Ecosystem Services, particularly on air quality. Nonetheless, scientific knowledge of the effects derived by Land Use Changes on air quality is inadequate for planning proposals. This paper proposes an analytical application in the metropolitan area of Milan (North-west of Italy), one of the highly air-polluted areas of Europe. A spatial-based methodology to predict Particulate Matter concentration is tested using the regional emission inventory as a benchmark. The paper assumes that different dynamics cause of air pollution: (i) atmospheric emissions due to different kinds of land use sources; (ii) the rebound/resuspension of particles caused by the impervious degree of soil, and (iii) the absorption through green areas and trees. The methodological innovations introduced by this paper are related to (i) the small gridded distribution of values, and (ii) the emissions dynamics mix up with those on resuspension and absorption.

The analysis and quantification of Ecosystem Services, intended as the benefits people obtain from ecosystems, play a crucial role in sustainable landscape planning. In this framework we developed a novel method for the identification and characterization of the landscapes nested along the urban-rural-natural gradient and the analysis of potential {ES} supply and demand within said landscapes. The Kernel Density Estimation technique was applied to calculate continuous intensity indicators associated with urbanization, agriculture, and natural elements, considered as key components of the gradient. The potential {ES} demand and supply within each landscape area were assessed using expert–knowledge based indices associated to the {LULC} {CORINE} classes. Results showed a complex organization of “pillar” and transitional landscapes along the gradient, which match different bundles of {ES} demand and supply. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.cities.2019.03.016},
	abstract = {The ecosystem services approach provides an efficient way to support urban green infrastructure planning. Such an assessment, together with mapping, can effectively produce spatial analyses on a specific scale, helping to maintain multi-functional landscapes and plan urban green infrastructure. In turn, green infrastructure can offer a wide variety of ecosystem services, promoting landscape sustainability. This study develops a methodology for the planning of urban green infrastructure based on an ecosystem services approach that assesses the supply capacity of ecosystem services, and identifies possible spatial characteristic areas for interlinking urban green infrastructure within the study area. More specifically, from a landscape perspective, we use 32 ecosystem services (as X-axis) and different land use types (as Y-axis) to build an ecosystem service assessment matrix. We then take the municipality of Barcelona as an example, using the latter to assess and map ecosystem services within the city through {ArcGIS}, which shows the spatial distribution characteristics of ecosystem services provision. We identify possible spatial areas - which include ecosystem services provision, barren, and obstructed areas - by overlapping the ecosystem services assessment maps. Ultimately, the results provide a reference for urban green infrastructure planning by recognizing priority protected areas, new construction areas, potential areas, and renewal areas. © 2019},

	doi = {10.3389/fenvs.2019.00093},
	abstract = {In urban areas, estimating the effect of land cover ({LC}) data spatial resolution on ecosystem services ({ES}) mapping remains a challenge. In particular, mapping spatial flows of {ES}, from greenspaces to beneficiaries, may be more sensitive to {LC} data resolution than mapping potential supply or demand separately. Our objectives were to compare the sensitivity of global- and local-flow {ES} maps to {LC} data resolution, and to assess the effect of {LC} data resolution within different types of urban land uses. A case study was conducted in the city of Laval, Canada. Carbon storage (a global-flow {ES}), urban cooling and pollination (two local-flow {ES}) were mapped using {LC} data aggregated from 1 to 15 m. Results were analyzed for districts (comprising various types of urban land uses), and for 480 × 480m residential and commercial zones. Greenspace cover was generally underestimated at coarser spatial resolutions; as a result, so were {ES} potential supply and flow. For urban cooling and pollination, the effect of {LC} data spatial resolution on {ES} flow also depended on changes in the spatial configuration of {ES} potential supply relative to {ES} demand. The magnitude of the effect differed among land use types. However, the effect was also highly variable between similar landscapes, suggesting that it is very sensitive to {LC} structure. To adequately map the {ES} provided by the small greenspaces scattered throughout the urban matrix, using land cover data with a spatial resolution of 5m or finer is recommended, especially for local-flow {ES}. © 2019 Rioux, Cimon-Morin, Pellerin, Alard and Poulin.},

	abstract = {Recent scientific developments are advancing to link land use and land cover ({LULC}) change with ecosystem service ({ES}) potentials. Such links within peri-urban ecosystems are scanty due to methodological and expertise challenge, and data limitation. The study applies the `{ES} matrix approach' to spatially display potentials for regulating {ES} in mainly overlooked data-scarce peri-urban areas, whereby {LULC} classes and qualitative {ES} values are the main data inputs. The {LULC} maps are based on {LANDSAT} satellite images from the years 1990, 2000 and 2010. {ES} potentials were assessed qualitatively on a relative scale ranging between 0 and 5 by use of interview data from local people. Results show that with exception of settlements, the area for all {LULC} classes decreased between 1990 and 2010. The `matrix approach' successfully generated {ES} potential maps for the different {LULC} classes. Grasslands, forests and wetlands have comparatively high potentials for regulating {ES}, whereas settlements and `otherlands' showed lower potentials. The main uncertainties of the study relate to study area selection, data accuracy and reliability, and `matrix approach' adaptability. Results indicate that the potential of the area to provide regulating {ES} is declining over time. To realize suitable and reliable results, it is necessary to conduct data accuracy-check during and after the fieldwork exercise. © 2018, © 2018 The Author(s).

In this paper, we focus on the geospatial approach used to assess and quantify the ecosystem services provided by the urban ecosystems and its possibilities for producing maps at multiple scales. The assessment of ecosystem services is based on various indicators, which rely on different data sources with their own origins, scales, and levels of precision. We develop seven {GIS}-based approaches that comprise different procedures and tools to arrange the available data and produce {ES} maps. The assessment is applied to 20 ecosystem services defined as relevant to the urban ecosystems in the country. We produced maps at multiple scales for selected individual services.

However, there is little attention for the accuracy of these maps. We made a systematic review and quantitative comparison of ecosystem service maps on the European scale to generate insights in the uncertainty of ecosystem service maps and discuss the possibilities for quantitative validation. Maps of climate regulation and recreation were reasonably similar while large uncertainties among maps of erosion protection and flood regulation were observed. Pollination maps had a moderate similarity. Differences among the maps were caused by differences in indicator definition, level of process understanding, mapping aim, data sources and methodology. Absence of suitable observed data on ecosystem services provisioning hampers independent validation of the maps. Consequently, there are, so far, no accurate measures for ecosystem service map quality. Policy makers and other users need to be cautious when applying ecosystem service maps for decision-making.

Employing the ecosystem service concept is intended to support the development of policies and instruments that integrate social, economic and ecological perspectives. In recent years, this concept has become the paradigm of ecosystem management. 2. The prolific use of the term `ecosystem services' in scientific studies has given rise to concerns about its arbitrary application. A quantitative review of recent literature shows the diversity of approaches and uncovers a lack of consistent methodology. 3. From this analysis, we have derived four facets that characterise the holistic ideal of ecosystem services research: (i) biophysical realism of ecosystem data and models; (ii) consideration of local trade-offs; (iii) recognition of off-site effects; and (iv) comprehensive but critical involvement of stakeholders within assessment studies. 4. These four facets should be taken as a methodological blueprint for further development and discussion. They should critically reveal and elucidate what may often appear to be ad-hoc approaches to ecosystem service assessments. 5. Synthesis and applications: Based on this quantitative review, we provide guidelines for further development and discussions supporting consistency in applications of the ecosystem service concept as well as the credibility of results, which in turn can make it easier to generalise from the numerous individual studies.},

Heterogeneous landscapes are capable of providing multiple {ESs}, and landscape configuration—spatial arrangement of land cover in the landscape—is expected to affect {ES} capacity. However, the majority of {ES} mapping studies have not accounted for landscape configuration.{ObjectivesOur} objective is to assess and quantify the relevance of configuration for mapping {ES} capacity. A review of empirical evidence for configuration effects on the capacity of ten {ESs} reveals that for four {ESs} configuration is relevant but typically ignored in {ES} quantification. For four {ESs} we quantify the relevance of configuration for mapping {ESs} using Scotland as a case study.{MethodsEach} {ES} was quantified through modelling, respectively ignoring or accounting for configuration. The difference in {ES} capacity between the two {ES} models was determined at multiple spatial scales.{ResultsConfiguration} affected the capacity of all four {ESs} mapped, particularly at the cell and watershed scale. At the scale of Scotland most local effects averaged out. Flood control and sediment retention responded strongest to configuration. {ESs} were affected by different aspects of configuration, thus requiring specific methods for mapping each {ES}.{ConclusionsAccounting} for configuration is important for the assessment of certain {ESs} at the cell and watershed scale. Incorporating configuration in landscape management provides opportunities for spatial optimization of {ES} capacity, but the diverging response of {ESs} to configuration suggests that accounting for configuration involves trade-offs between {ESs}.},

It is framed by a broad set of key policy questions and structured around a conceptual framework that links human societies and their well-being with the environment. Next, this framework is tested through four thematic pilot studies, including stakeholders and experts working at different scales and governance levels, which contributed indicators to assess the state of ecosystem services. Indicators were scored according to different criteria and assorted per ecosystem type and ecosystem services using the common international classification of ecosystem services ({CICES}) as typology.

In each case, a unique typology of land cover and aquatic resources was developed and relevant economic valuation studies were queried in order to assign estimates of ecosystem service values to each category in the typology. The result was a set of unique standardized ecosystem service value coefficients broken down by land cover class and service type for each case study. {GIS} analysis was then used to map the spatial distribution of each cover class at each study site. Economic values were summarized and mapped by tributary basin for Massachusetts and California and by property parcel for Maury Island. For Maury Island, changes in ecosystem service value flows were estimated under two alternative development scenarios. Drawing on lessons learned during the implementation of the case studies, the authors present some of the practical challenges that accompany spatially explicit ecosystem service value transfer. They also discuss how variability in the site characteristics and data availability for each project limits the ability to generalize a single comprehensive methodology.},

We illustrate this for carbon storage in the Eastern Arc Mountains of Tanzania using two scenarios: the first based on sustainable development, the second based on 'business as usual' with continued forest-woodland degradation and poor protection of existing forest reserves. Between 2000 and 2025 4\% of carbon stocks were lost under the first scenario compared to a loss of 41\% of carbon stocks under the second scenario. Quantifying the impacts of differing future scenarios using the method we document here will be important if payments for ecosystem services are to be used to change policy in order to maintain critical ecosystem services.},

This study illustrates that (1) most of South Africa's land surface is important for supplying at least one service, (2) there are low levels of congruence between the service ranges and even lower levels between the hotspots for different ecosystem services, and (3) primary production appears to show some potential as a surrogate for ecosystem service distribution.

	abstract = {A {GIS}-based approach was designed to spatially estimate direct use value of ecosystem services and to map results for a case study at county scale. The approach highlights the use of {GIS} to collect data, perform spatial analysis, and map economic values of ecosystem services. Three key steps of spatial valuation for agricultural products, forest products, and tourism services were illustrated in the {GIS}-based technical framework. We applied this approach to the Tiantai County (1423.8Â km2) in Zhejiang province of southeast China. Selected components of natural products and tourism services in the case area were mapped as data layers in {GIS}, with each layer containing monetary values for every 25Â m cell. The total direct use value of ecosystem services was estimated in {RMB} to be approximately 538Â million Yuan in 2005 (Chinese currency, 8.2Â {YuanÂ} =Â {US}\$1), of which agricultural products, forest products and tourism services accounted for 65\%, 30\% and 5\%, respectively. The critical areas for management purpose were identified depending on the heterogeneity of direct use services learned from the case study. The spatially explicit measures provide a mechanism for incorporating spatial context into ecosystem services evaluation. Based on the present {GIS}-based approach and case study, the suggestions and implications for local resources protection and eco-environmental management were extensively discussed. The work was expected to highlight research avenues to advance the ecosystem services framework as an operational basis for regional ecosystem-based management.},

The framework was applied to the Gelderse Vallei, a transitional rural area in the Netherlands. We successfully mapped and quantified the capacities to provide goods and services of eight landscape functions (residential, intensive livestock, drinking water, cultural heritage, tourism, plant habitat, arable production, and leisure cycling function) for this region. These function maps provide policy makers valuable information on regional qualities in terms of landscape functionality. Making landscape functions spatial explicit, adds an important component to research conducted in the field of quantification of landscape goods and services.},

This is a pre-requisite for a sustainable development with a balance between ecological, social and economic values. We analyse ecosystem services in areas of the urban fringe of Copenhagen, where the services provided are mainly related to human perception. We employ relatively simple methods in selected landscapes to qualify or quantify the aesthetics and recreational value, and the scale of the welfare economic value of these ecosystem services. In the first case area, the Danish state acquired 50 villas covering more than 50 ha in order to recreate open vistas and gain access for the public to the seaside. In the second case area, peri-urban open landscapes were protected by conservation orders, to maintain and enhance the benefits of green space for the growing urban population. We assess the value – in a broad sense – of these ecosystem services using three practical methods: a landscape evaluation in terms of services and qualities, an assessment of actual recreational use, and finally an assessment of the costs – in terms of residential development values lost – of securing the provision of aesthetic qualities and recreational opportunities.},

This suggests that at any given density, there is substantial scope for maximising ecological performance. The social status of residents was related to measures of tree cover. Housing type was significantly associated with some types of ecosystem service provision, indicating that the type of development may be important independent of its density.

	abstract = {Peri-urban areas are often characterized by valuable natural environments that provide essential life-support functions and ecosystem services for urban residents. Global environmental change has raised concerns over how urbanization and land use and land cover change affect ecosystem services. This study applied systems ecology theory and ecological energetic analysis to value the worth of natural environment and ecosystem services to a socioeconomic system. We begin with a general discussion of peri-urban areas and their ecosystem services. An emergy approach is applied to establish a framework for evaluating the ecosystem services by identifying systemic roles of each system components. The two-part framework includes: (1) an emergy evaluation of energetic flows of ecosystem services; and (2) an impact matrix to analyze systemic roles of services in the analyzed system. On the basis of the proposed valuation framework and land cover types in the greater Taipei area, this study analyzed ten ecosystems to determine how they interact, via energy flows, to contribute services to human society. By converting all stocks and flows into common emergy units, an impact matrix is constructed to analyze the systemic role of ecosystem components by classifying their status of being active, reactive, critical or indifferent. The analytical results indicate that the soil component of forest ecosystems, upstream rivers and agricultural productivity play critical role of ecosystem services in the study region. The effect of land cover change during 1971–2006 in the study region on ecosystem services is also analyzed. Finally, the implications of biophysical valuation of ecosystem service for spatial planning as related to adapting to global environmental change are discussed.},

	doi = {10.1111/1365-2664.12469},
	abstract = {The urban dimension of ecosystem services ({ES}) is underexposed, while the importance of {ES} for human wellbeing is nowhere as evident as in cities. Urban challenges such as air pollution, noise, and heat can be moderated by urban green space ({UGS}), simultaneously providing multiple other services. However, available methods to quantify {ES} cannot typically deal with the high spatial and thematic resolution land cover data that is needed to better understand {ES} supply in the urban context.This study derives methods to quantify and map a bundle of six {ES} as supplied by {UGS}, using land cover data with high spatial and thematic resolution, and applies these to the city of Rotterdam, the Netherlands. Land cover data comprise eight classes of {UGS}. Methods are derived from an evidence base on the importance of {UGS} types for the supply of each of the six {ES} that was built using literature review.The evidence base reveals that {UGS} types differ in their contribution to various {ES}, although the strength of the evidence varies. However, existing indicators for urban {ES} often do not discriminate between {UGS} types. To derive {UGS}-specific indicators, we combined methods and evidence from different research contexts ({ES}, non-{ES}, urban, non-urban).Rotterdam shows high spatial variation in the amount of {UGS} present, and accounting for this in {ES} supply reveals that {ES} bundles depend on {UGS} composition and configuration. While the contribution of {UGS} types to {ES} supply differed markedly with {UGS} type and {ES} considered, we demonstrate that synergies rather than trade-offs exist among the {ES} analysed.Synthesis and applications. Our findings underline the importance of a careful design of urban green space ({UGS}) in city planning for ecosystem services ({ES}) provision. Based on the latest insights on how different {UGS} provide {ES}, the methods presented in this study enable a more detailed quantification and mapping of the supply of {ES} in cities, allowing assessments of current supply of key urban {ES} and alternative urban designs. Such knowledge is indispensable in the quest for designing healthier and climate-resilient cities.This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.envsci.2015.07.009},
	abstract = {Identifying, promoting and preserving a strategically planned green infrastructure ({GI}) network can provide ecological, economic and social benefits. It has also become a priority for the planning and decision-making process in sectors such as conservation, (land) resource efficiency, agriculture, forestry or urban development.In this paper we propose a methodology that can be used to identify and map {GI} elements at landscape level based on the notions of ecological connectivity, multi-functionality of ecosystems and maximisation of benefits both for humans and for natural conservation. Our approach implies, first, the quantification and mapping of the natural capacity to deliver ecosystem services and, secondly, the identification of core habitats and wildlife corridors for biota. All this information is integrated and finally classified in a two-level {GI} network. The methodology is replicable and flexible (it can be tailored to the objectives and priorities of the practitioners); and it can be used at different spatial scales for research, planning or policy implementation.The method is applied in a continental scale analysis covering the {EU}-27 territory, taking into account the delivery of eight regulating and maintenance ecosystem services and the requirements of large mammals' populations. The best performing areas for ecosystem services and/or natural habitat provision cover 23\% of Europe and are classified as the core {GI} network. Another 16\% of the study area with relatively good ecological performance is classified as the subsidiary {GI} network. There are large differences in the coverage of the {GI} network among countries ranging from 73\% of the territory in Estonia to 6\% in Cyprus. A potential application of these results is the implementation of the {EU} Biodiversity Strategy, assuming that the core {GI} network might be crucial to maintain biodiversity and natural capital and, thus, should be conserved; while the subsidiary network could be restored to increase both the ecological and social resilience. This kind of {GI} analysis could be also included in the negotiations of the European Regional Development Funds or the Rural Development Programmes. © 2015 The Authors.},

	abstract = {We present an approach to identify and map social-ecological systems based on the direct use of ecosystem services by households. This approach builds on the premise that characteristic bundles of ecosystem service use represent integrated expressions of different underlying social-ecological systems. We test the approach in South Africa using national census data on the direct use of six provisioning services (freshwater from a natural source, firewood for cooking, firewood for heating, natural building materials, animal production, and crop production) at two different scales. Based on a cluster analysis, we identify three distinct ecosystem service bundles that represent social-ecological systems characterized by low, medium and high levels of direct ecosystem service use among households. We argue that these correspond to 'green-loop', 'transition' and 'red-loop' systems as defined by Cumming et al. (2014). When mapped, these systems form coherent spatial units that differ from systems identified by additive combinations of separate social and biophysical datasets, the most common method of mapping social-ecological systems to date. The distribution of the systems we identified is mainly determined by social factors, such as household income, gender of the household head, and land tenure, and only partly determined by the supply of natural resources. An understanding of the location and characteristic resource use dynamics of different social-ecological systems allows for policies to be better targeted at the particular sustainability challenges faced in different areas. © 2015 Z.},

	abstract = {The economic value of ecosystem services (non-market) and the market value (represented by a proxy of gross domestic product ({GDP})) represent the synthetic green {GDP} of the earth and of different nations. Mapping and estimating national green {GDPs} is a challenging task. In this study, we estimated the global market and non-market monetary values using two images, {GlobCover} 2009 and nighttime satellite imagery, as well as a comprehensive dataset. We also developed an integrated method supported by geographic information system ({GIS}) techniques, focused on spatial heterogeneity and real value, to create synthetic green {GDP} maps at global and national scales. Our results show that in 2009, for the entire biosphere, the ecosystem services value ({ESV}) could be estimated at {US}\$ 149.61 trillion. Approximately 75.15\% of the {ESV} is contributed by marine systems. The world {GDP} in 2009 was about {US}\$ 71.75 trillion (for 225 countries or regions), resulting in a ratio of total {ESV} to {GDP} of approximately 2.09-1. Nighttime satellite imagery represents a more spatially explicit indicator of market value than does {GDP}. We also found that the distribution of the synthetic national green {GDPs} follows Zipf's Law, which holds that internal coherence exists among countries. A crude but simple indicator of the \%{ESV} indicates that the relationship between the {GDP} and {ESV} is not always in a fixed pattern. The reliability of this result was demonstrated by comparing it with previous research and other relevant indices. We found a very high degree of confidence associated with this product. The method presented here is generally applicable at the global and continental scales and is applicable at the national scale for mapping the {ESV} and {GDP}. We hope that the results of this study will inform both policy-makers and the public about national green {GDPs} and encourage them to incorporate these values into policy decisions. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {Urban ecosystem services ({ESs}) can moderate many common environmental issues in cities that are caused by the land use transformation central to urbanization. However, quantitative knowledge of historical changes in {ES} provisioning at various urban scales is limited. In this research, it is proposed to identify {ESs}, especially those generated by urban green space ({UGS}), and quantify their spatiotemporal variations at the regional scale in the southern part of Seoul City, Korea. Changes are first detected in landscape patterns, then one {ES} indicator - carbon sequestration ({CS}) - is chosen as a test case, and its spatial pattern explored using the Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs ({InVEST}) model. Total potential {CS} decreased by 41.2\% from 1975 to 2015, with loss and fragmentation of landscapes occurring and patches becoming smaller and simpler in shape in the urban area, as indicated by landscape metrics. Moreover, strong decreases in urban forest and agricultural areas were the primary causes of loss of {CS}. On the other hand, a 120\% increase in the grassland area somewhat offset these two factors. It is hoped that these results will contribute to cognizance of the potential of historical processes to inform future policy decisions related to green infrastructure and land-use planning. © {SPSD} Press from 2010, {SPSD} Press, Kanazawa.},

	abstract = {This paper proposes a measurement system of {QoS} parameters for a {SIP} based Internet telephony service. This system is called {QoS} agent and will allow telephony user to receive alerts in real time if network conditions are not suitable to make a call. Two complementary types of measurement methods will be used. The first one is called incall method which uses {RTCP} packets statistics obtained during the first seconds of a call in progress. The second one is called outcall method. It periodically uses the {SIP} {OPTIONS} method to obtain delay statistics out of a call. This system constitutes an alternative solution of {QoS} management for {IP} telephony service providers that use third party's infrastructure to provide the service},

	abstract = {Recently, fully-connected and convolutional neural networks have been trained to achieve state-of-the-art performance on a wide variety of tasks such as speech recognition, image classification, natural language processing, and bioinformatics. For classification tasks, most of these "deep learning" models employ the softmax activation function for prediction and minimize cross-entropy loss. In this paper, we demonstrate a small but consistent advantage of replacing the softmax layer with a linear support vector machine. Learning minimizes a margin-based loss instead of the cross-entropy loss. While there have been various combinations of neural nets and {SVMs} in prior art, our results using L2-{SVMs} show that by simply replacing softmax with linear {SVMs} gives significant gains on popular deep learning datasets {MNIST}, {CIFAR}-10, and the {ICML} 2013 Representation Learning Workshop's face expression recognition challenge.},

	doi = {10.3390/s19204357},
	abstract = {There are many sensor fusion frameworks proposed in the literature using different sensors and fusion methods combinations and configurations. More focus has been on improving the accuracy performance; however, the implementation feasibility of these frameworks in an autonomous vehicle is less explored. Some fusion architectures can perform very well in lab conditions using powerful computational resources; however, in real-world applications, they cannot be implemented in an embedded edge computer due to their high cost and computational need. We propose a new hybrid multi-sensor fusion pipeline configuration that performs environment perception for autonomous vehicles such as road segmentation, obstacle detection, and tracking. This fusion framework uses a proposed encoder-decoder based Fully Convolutional Neural Network ({FCNx}) and a traditional Extended Kalman Filter ({EKF}) nonlinear state estimator method. It also uses a configuration of camera, {LiDAR}, and radar sensors that are best suited for each fusion method. The goal of this hybrid framework is to provide a cost-effective, lightweight, modular, and robust (in case of a sensor failure) fusion system solution. It uses {FCNx} algorithm that improve road detection accuracy compared to benchmark models while maintaining real-time efficiency that can be used in an autonomous vehicle embedded computer. Tested on over 3K road scenes, our fusion algorithm shows better performance in various environment scenarios compared to baseline benchmark networks. Moreover, the algorithm is implemented in a vehicle and tested using actual sensor data collected from a vehicle, performing real-time environment perception.},

In this paper, after analyzing different road features and road models, the road extraction methods were classified into the classification-based methods, knowledge-based methods, mathematical morphology, active contour model, and dynamic programming. Firstly, the road features, road model, existing difficulties and interference factors for road extraction were analyzed. Secondly, the principle of road extraction, the advantages and disadvantages of various methods and research achievements were briefly highighted. Then, the comparisons of the different road extraction algorithms were performed, including road features, test samples and shortcomings. Finally, the research results in recent years were summarized emphatically. It is obvious that only using one kind of road features is hard to get an excellent extraction effect. Hence, in order to get good results, the road extraction should combine multiple methods according to the real applications. In the future, how to realize the complete road extraction from a {RS} image is still an essential but challenging and important research topic.},

The results have the premise to be applied for evaluating different maintenance strategies using safety as a performance measure. As part of this approach, this research introduces a road surface condition index as a surrogate measure of the commonly used friction measure to capture different road surface conditions. Data from various data sources, such as weather, road condition observations, traffic counts and accidents, are integrated and used to test three event-based models including the Negative Binomial model, the generalized {NB} model and the zero inflated {NB} model. These models are compared for their capability to explain differences in accident frequencies between individual snow storms. It was found that the generalized {NB} model best fits the data, and is most capable of capturing heterogeneity other than excess zeros. Among the main results, it was found that the road surface condition index was statistically significant influencing the accident occurrence. This research is the first showing the empirical relationship between safety and road surface conditions at a disaggregate level (event-based), making it feasible to quantify the safety benefits of alternative maintenance goals and methods.},

The composed hardware to measure weather are microprocessor, temperature sensor, humidity sensor, atmospheric pressure sensor, precipitation sensor, {LTE} modem, solar cell panel and its controller, and battery. In addition to, there are software for forecasting freezing located in a specific area where devices to detect data such as temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, and road temperature are installed for the purpose of not only transmitting their data but also data storage through wireless internet modem. Real-time monitoring and an algorithm for forecasting freezing make it possible to predict freezing by utilizing the accumulated data. Freezing on road can be occurred according to bigger humidity, big difference of humidity as well as of atmospheric pressure. The measurement of atmospheric temperature as well as road temperature, atmospheric pressure and humidity is conducted by the proposed system in this study. The relationship between a changing weather data in the past winter seasons during from 15th November to 31th March and the amount of precipitation included a snowfall is grasped to digitize. Present weather information is applied by not only detecting the phenomenon to show changing at constant humidity, atmospheric pressure, and temperature but also calculating a precipitation probability in case of this reiteration phenomenon or particularly higher humidity as well as particularly lower atmospheric pressure to grasp of relations with precipitation. The proposed system is composed up four steps such as good, concern, caution, and warning through forecasting freezing time from 3 hours ago. Therefore, it is possible not only to forecast freezing hazard up to 70\% due to frozen rain but also to use snow-removing work prepared in advance as well as weather information aids by forecasting freezing. © {BEIESP}.},

	abstract = {The appearance of active safety systems, such as Anti-lock Braking System, Traction Control System, Stability Control System, etc., represents a major evolution in road safety. In the automotive sector, the term vehicle active safety systems refers to those whose goal is to help avoid a crash or to reduce the risk of having an accident. These systems safeguard us, being in continuous evolution and incorporating new capabilities continuously. In order for these systems and vehicles to work adequately, they need to know some fundamental information: the road condition on which the vehicle is circulating. This early road detection is intended to allow vehicle control systems to act faster and more suitably, thus obtaining a substantial advantage. In this work, we try to detect the road condition the vehicle is being driven on, using the standard sensors installed in commercial vehicles. Vehicle models were programmed in on-board systems to perform real-time estimations of the forces of contact between the wheel and road and the speed of the vehicle. Subsequently, a fuzzy logic block is used to obtain an index representing the road condition. Finally, an artificial neural network was used to provide the optimal slip for each surface. Simulations and experiments verified the proposed method. © 2015 by the authors; licensee {MDPI}, Basel, Switzerland.},

	doi = {10.1007/978-3-030-17795-9_14},
	abstract = {Automated interpretation and understanding of the driving environment using image processing is a challenging task, as most current vision-based systems are not designed to work in dynamically-changing and naturalistic real-world settings. For instance, road weather condition classification using a camera is a challenge due to high variance in weather, road layout, and illumination conditions. Most transportation agencies, within the U.S., have deployed some cameras for operational awareness. Given that weather related crashes constitute 22\% of all vehicle crashes and 16\% of crash fatalities, this study proposes using these same cameras as a source for estimating roadway surface condition. The developed model is focused on three road surface conditions resulting from weather including: Clear (clear/dry), Rainy-Wet (rainy/slushy/wet), and Snow (snow-covered/partially snow-covered). The camera sources evaluated are both fixed Closed-circuit Television ({CCTV}) and mobile (snow plow dash-cam). The results are promising; with an achieved 98.57\% and 77.32\% road weather classification accuracy for {CCTV} and mobile cameras, respectively. Proposed classification method is suitable for autonomous selection of snow plow routes and verification of extreme road conditions on roadways. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland {AG}.},

	doi = {10.14135/j.cnki.1006-3080.20180119001},
	abstract = {Nowadays, automatic driving and assisted driving techniques have been receiving more and more attentions. Due to the limitation of visible light sensor at night, it is difficult for vehicles to automatically observe the road conditions and correctly understand the driving environment. To address these problems, this paper proposes a method to segment night scene semantically by combining the visible and infrared thermal images' information. Firstly, the dual-band images are input into the parallel fully convolutional network, and the semantic segmentation is realized effectively by combing the two-way network's information at the end of the network. Besides, we implement adaptive histogram equalization and bilateral filtering on the dual-band images and improve the final segmentation result by a dense condition random field. In order to verify the proposed algorithm, we collect and annotate 541 pairs of visible and infrared thermal images in urban road sence, and 200 pairs of visible and infrared thermal images in campus road scene via {KAIST} all-day visual place recognition database. Experiment results show that the semantic segmentation method based on visible image may be infected by headlights and has a relatively low segmentation accuracy on persons and cars. The method based on thermal infarad image is good at segment heat source objects, but it cannot recognize the objects via textures or colors. The method based on color fusion image considers the characteristics of visible and thermal infarad images and gets some improvement. Futhermore, parallel fully convolutional network can more accurately resolve the night road scene than using only visible images, infrared thermal images or fusion images. The image enhancement processing can further improve the optimization of densecondition random field on seriously under-lit road scene images. © 2019, Editorial Department of Journal of East China University of Science and Technology.

It has proven to be a dominant technology to carry out tasks such as image classification, semantic segmentation, and object detection. The convolution neural networks surpass the performance of the existing algorithms such as {SIFT}, {HOG}, etcetera. Where, instead of manually engineering the features, supervised learning help to learn the essential low-level and high-level features necessary for classifications. The convolution neural networks have become a popular tool to counter computer vision problems. However, it is computationally, and memory intensive to train and deploy the network because of the model size of a deep convolution neural networks. However, the research in the field of design space exploration ({DSE}) of neural networks and compression techniques to develop compact architectures, have made convolution neural networks memory and computationally efficient. These techniques have also improved the feasibility of convolution neural network for deployment on embedded targets. The paper explores the concept of compact convolution filters to reduce the number of parameters in a convolution neural network. The intuition behind the approach is that replacing convolution filters with a stack of compact convolution filters helps in developing a compact architecture with competitive accuracy.

When {IoT} concept meets agriculture, the future of farming is pushed to the next level, giving birth to what is called “Smart Agriculture” or “Precision Agriculture”. The most important benefit from {IoT} is that a user can daily monitor his crop online in a seamless fashion. High quality data gathered from various sensors and transferred wirelessly to farm database will increase farmers understanding to their landuse leading to increasing income and product quality. One of the monitoring process is weeds detection and crop yield estimation using camera sensors. The acquired images help farmers to build map of weeds distribution or yield quantity all over the field, these maps can be used either for real-time processing or to predetermine weeds regions based on field maps history of the previous seasons. This process is referred to as segmentation problem. Several algorithms have been proposed for that purpose, however, these algorithms were run only on high performance computers. In this paper, we evaluate performance and the robustness of the most used legacy algorithms under local conditions. We focused on implementing these schemes within real-time application constraint. For instance, these algorithms were implemented and run in a low-cost embedded system. © Springer International Publishing {AG} 2017.},

	doi = {10.1109/IVS.2018.8500598},
	abstract = {Multilane detection system is a vital prerequisite for realizing higher {ADAS} functionality of autonomous navigation. In this work, we present an efficient convolutional neural network ({CNN}) architecture for real time detection of multiple lane boundaries using a camera sensor. Our network has a simple encoder-decoder architecture and is a special two class semantic segmentation network designed to segment lane boundaries. Efficacy of our network stems from two key insights which are at the foundation of all our design decisions. Firstly, we term a lane boundary as a weak class object in the context of semantic segmentation. We show that the weak class objects which occupy relatively few pixels in the scene, also have a relatively low detection accuracy among the know segmentation methods. We present novel design choices and intuitions to improve the segmentation accuracy of weak class objects, which in turn reduces computation time. Our second insight lies in the manner we depict the ground truth information in our derived dataset. Instead of annotating just the visible lane markers, we accurately delineate the lane boundaries in the ground truth for challenging scenarios like occlusions, low light and degraded lane markings. We then leverage the {CNN}'s ability to concisely summarize the global and local context in an image, for accurately inferring lane boundaries in these challenging cases. We evaluate our network against {ENet} and {FCN}-8, and found it performing notably better in terms of speed and accuracy. Our network achieves an encouraging 46 {FPS} performance on {NVIDIA} Drive {PX}2 platform and it has been validated on our test vehicle in highway driving conditions. © 2018 {IEEE}.},

	abstract = {The Internet of Things ({IoT}) becomes very important tool for data gathering and management in many environments. The majority of dedicated solutions register data only at time of events, while in case of medical data full records for long time periods are usually needed. The precision of acquired data and the amount of data sent by sensor-equipped {IoT} devices has vital impact on lifetime of these devices. In case of solutions, where multiple sensors are available for single device with limited computation power and memory, the complex compression or transformation methods cannot be applied - especially in case of nano device injected to a body. Thus this paper is focused on linear complexity segmentation algorithms that can be used by the resource-limited devices. The state-of-art data segmentation methods are analysed and adapted for simple {IoT} devices. Two segmentation algorithms are proposed and tested on a real-world dataset collected from a prototype of the {IoT} device. © 2017, Springer International Publishing {AG}.},

In particular, recent results depict a hopeful prospect for image processing using convolutional neural networks, {CNNs}, but the gap between software and hardware implementations is already considerable for {IoT} and mobile edge computing applications due to their high power consumption. This proposal performs low-power and real time deep learning-based multiple object visual tracking implemented on an {NVIDIA} Jetson {TX}2 development kit. It includes a camera and wireless connection capability and it is battery powered for mobile and outdoor applications. A collection of representative sequences captured with the on-board camera, {dETRUSC} video dataset, is used to exemplify the performance of the proposed algorithm and to facilitate benchmarking. The results in terms of power consumption and frame rate demonstrate the feasibility of deep learning algorithms on embedded platforms although more effort in the joint algorithm and hardware design of {CNNs} is needed.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.08469},
	abstract = {Recent success of semantic segmentation approaches on demanding road driving datasets has spurred interest in many related application fields. Many of these applications involve real-time prediction on mobile platforms such as cars, drones and various kinds of robots. Real-time setup is challenging due to extraordinary computational complexity involved. Many previous works address the challenge with custom lightweight architectures which decrease computational complexity by reducing depth, width and layer capacity with respect to general purpose architectures. We propose an alternative approach which achieves a significantly better performance across a wide range of computing budgets. First, we rely on a light-weight general purpose architecture as the main recognition engine. Then, we leverage light-weight upsampling with lateral connections as the most cost-effective solution to restore the prediction resolution. Finally, we propose to enlarge the receptive field by fusing shared features at multiple resolutions in a novel fashion. Experiments on several road driving datasets show a substantial advantage of the proposed approach, either with {ImageNet} pre-trained parameters or when we learn from scratch. Our Cityscapes test submission entitled {SwiftNetRN}-18 delivers 75.5\% {MIoU} and achieves 39.9 Hz on 1024×2048 images on {GTX}1080Ti.},

	abstract = {Since the resurgence of {CNNs} the robotic vision community has developed a range of algorithms that perform classification, semantic segmentation and structure prediction (depths, normals, surface curvature) using neural networks. While some of these models achieve state-of-the art results and super human level performance, deploying these models in a time critical robotic environment remains an ongoing challenge. Real-time frameworks are of paramount importance to build a robotic society where humans and robots integrate seamlessly. To this end, we present a novel real-time structure prediction framework that predicts depth at 30 frames per second on an {NVIDIA}-{TX}2. At the time of writing, this is the first piece of work to showcase such a capability on a mobile platform. We also demonstrate with extensive experiments that neural networks with very large model capacities can be leveraged in order to train accurate condensed model architectures in a “from teacher to student” style knowledge transfer.},

Internet of Things ({IoT}) is expected to drive hyper-personalization going forward, i.e., enable personalization across the board, for example but not limited to, home, health care, marketing, transportation, energy, infrastructure.

With {BigData} analytics becoming mainstream since the turn of the century and the growing need to leverage real-time data to grow business, several real-time systems are being researched and deployed in the consumer space. Although a lot of emphasis is being laid on real-time processing, the notion of real-time is not well defined. This, in part, stems from the fact that the notion of real-time is a function of the target application.

	doi = {10.1109/ISQED.2018.8357325},
	abstract = {Automated driving functions, like highway driving and parking assist, are increasingly getting deployed in high-end cars with the ultimate goal of realizing self-driving car using Deep learning techniques like convolution neural network ({CNN}). For mass-market deployment, the embedded solution is required to address the right cost and performance envelope along with security and safety. In the case of automated driving, one of the key functionality is 'finding drivable free space', which is addressed using deep learning techniques like {CNN}. These {CNN} networks pose huge computing requirements in terms of hundreds of {GOPS}/{TOPS} (Giga or Tera operations per second), which seems beyond the capability of today's embedded {SoC}. This paper covers various techniques consisting of fixed-point conversion, sparse multiplication, fusing of layers and network pruning, for tailoring on the embedded solution. These techniques are implemented on the device by means of optimized Deep learning library for inference. The paper concludes by demonstrating the results of a {CNN} network running in real time on {TI}'s {TDA}2X embedded platform producing a high-quality drivable space output for automated driving. © 2018 {IEEE}.},

These findings were the basis of our {ImageNet} Challenge 2014 submission, where our team secured the first and the second places in the localisation and classification tracks respectively.

	abstract = {In the context of video segmentation with depth sensor, prior work maps the Metropolis algorithm, a simulated annealing based key routine during segmentation, onto an Nvidia Graphics Processing Unit ({GPU}) and achieves real-time performance for 320×256 video sequences. However that work utilizes depth information in a very limited manner. This paper presents a new {GPU}-based method that expands the use of depth information during segmentation and shows the improved segmentation quality over the prior work. In particular, we discuss various ways to restructure the segmentation flow, and evaluate the impact of several design choices on throughput and quality. We introduce a scaling factor for amplifying the interaction strength between two spatially neighboring pixels and increasing the clarity of borderlines. This allows us to reduce the number of required Metropolis iterations by over 50\% with the drawback of over-segmentation. We evaluate two design choices to overcome this problem. First, we incorporate depth information into the perceived color difference calculations between two pixels, and show that the interaction strengths between neighboring pixels can be more accurately modeled by incorporating depth information. Second, we pre-process the frames with Bilateral filter instead of Gaussian filter, and show its effectiveness in terms of reducing the difference between similar colors. Both approaches help improve the quality of the segmentation, and the reduction in Metropolis iterations helps improve the throughout from 29 fps to 34 fps for 320×256 video sequences.},

We use a multiple model fitting approach where each object can move independently from the background and still be effectively tracked and its shape fused over time using only the information from pixels associated with that object label. Previous attempts to deal with dynamic scenes have typically considered moving regions as outliers, and consequently do not model their shape or track their motion over time. In contrast, we enable the robot to maintain 3D models for each of the segmented objects and to improve them over time through fusion. As a result, our system can enable a robot to maintain a scene description at the object level which has the potential to allow interactions with its working environment; even in the case of dynamic scenes.},

We show that convolutional networks by themselves, trained end-to-end, pixels-to-pixels, exceed the state-of-the-art in semantic segmentation. Our key insight is to build “fully convolutional” networks that take input of arbitrary size and produce correspondingly-sized output with efficient inference and learning. We define and detail the space of fully convolutional networks, explain their application to spatially dense prediction tasks, and draw connections to prior models. We adapt contemporary classification networks ({AlexNet} [20], the {VGG} net [31], and {GoogLeNet} [32]) into fully convolutional networks and transfer their learned representations by fine-tuning [3] to the segmentation task. We then define a skip architecture that combines semantic information from a deep, coarse layer with appearance information from a shallow, fine layer to produce accurate and detailed segmentations. Our fully convolutional network achieves state-of-the-art segmentation of {PASCAL} {VOC} (20\% relative improvement to 62.2\% mean {IU} on 2012), {NYUDv}2, and {SIFT} Flow, while inference takes less than one fifth of a second for a typical image.},

	abstract = {We present {YOLO}, a new approach to object detection. Prior work on object detection repurposes classifiers to perform detection. Instead, we frame object detection as a regression problem to spatially separated bounding boxes and associated class probabilities. A single neural network predicts bounding boxes and class probabilities directly from full images in one evaluation. Since the whole detection pipeline is a single network, it can be optimized end-to-end directly on detection performance. Our unified architecture is extremely fast. Our base {YOLO} model processes images in real-time at 45 frames per second. A smaller version of the network, Fast {YOLO}, processes an astounding 155 frames per second while still achieving double the {mAP} of other real-time detectors. Compared to state-of-the-art detection systems, {YOLO} makes more localization errors but is far less likely to predict false detections where nothing exists. Finally, {YOLO} learns very general representations of objects. It outperforms all other detection methods, including {DPM} and R-{CNN}, by a wide margin when generalizing from natural images to artwork on both the Picasso Dataset and the People-Art Dataset.},

This study examines the determinants of utility cycling behaviour and intent, and more broadly, active transportation (i.e. cycling and walking) behaviour in Edmonton, Canada – the northernmost North American city with a metropolitan population over one million. With harsh winter weather and low cycling rates, the city presents a unique case study for cycling behavior. In this research, we analyzed 646 responses to a bike ridership survey conducted in 2014 by the City of Edmonton. Borrowing concepts from behaviour theory, public health and transportation engineering we seek to quantify the effects of infrastructure density, traffic attitude, perceived control over time and distance, and traffic stress tolerance perception on cycling for utility purposes, the intention to cycle more frequently, and the use of an active mode of transportation, specifically for a northern and low-cycling city. Three empirical models were developed to describe cycling behaviour using binary logistic regression. Most variables were significant and in line with other study findings in the current literature. Results point at the importance of perceived safety in deciding or intending to cycle, as well as perceived time and distance of travel.

	abstract = {Deeper neural networks are more difficult to train. We present a residual learning framework to ease the training of networks that are substantially deeper than those used previously. We explicitly reformulate the layers as learning residual functions with reference to the layer inputs, instead of learning unreferenced functions. We provide comprehensive empirical evidence showing that these residual networks are easier to optimize, and can gain accuracy from considerably increased depth. On the {ImageNet} dataset we evaluate residual nets with a depth of up to 152 layers—8x deeper than {VGG} nets but still having lower complexity. An ensemble of these residual nets achieves 3.57\% error on the {ImageNet} test set. This result won the 1st place on the {ILSVRC} 2015 classification task. We also present analysis on {CIFAR}-10 with 100 and 1000 layers. The depth of representations is of central importance for many visual recognition tasks. Solely due to our extremely deep representations, we obtain a 28\% relative improvement on the {COCO} object detection dataset. Deep residual nets are foundations of our submissions to {ILSVRC} \& {COCO} 2015 competitions, where we also won the 1st places on the tasks of {ImageNet} detection, {ImageNet} localization, {COCO} detection, and {COCO} segmentation.},

Semantic segmentation is an important tool for visual scene understanding and a meaningful measure of uncertainty is essential for decision making. Our contribution is a practical system which is able to predict pixel-wise class labels with a measure of model uncertainty. We achieve this by Monte Carlo sampling with dropout at test time to generate a posterior distribution of pixel class labels. In addition, we show that modelling uncertainty improves segmentation performance by 2-3\% across a number of state of the art architectures such as {SegNet}, {FCN} and Dilation Network, with no additional parametrisation. We also observe a significant improvement in performance for smaller datasets where modelling uncertainty is more effective.

Unlike some forms of aggression that are impossible to prevent in day-to-day life, aggressive speech abounding on social networks could in principle be prevented or at least reduced by simply disabling users that post aggressively worded messages. The first step in achieving this is to detect such messages. The task, however, is far from being trivial, as what is considered as aggressive speech can be quite subjective, and the task is further complicated by the noisy nature of user-generated text on social networks. Our system learns to distinguish between open aggression, covert aggression, and non-aggression in social media texts. We tried different machine learning approaches, including traditional (shallow) machine learning models, deep learning models, and a combination of both. We achieved respectable results, ranking 4th and 8th out of 31 submissions on the Facebook and Twitter test sets, respectively.},

	doi = {10.3390/s19204357},
	abstract = {There are many sensor fusion frameworks proposed in the literature using different sensors and fusion methods combinations and configurations. More focus has been on improving the accuracy performance; however, the implementation feasibility of these frameworks in an autonomous vehicle is less explored. Some fusion architectures can perform very well in lab conditions using powerful computational resources; however, in real-world applications, they cannot be implemented in an embedded edge computer due to their high cost and computational need. We propose a new hybrid multi-sensor fusion pipeline configuration that performs environment perception for autonomous vehicles such as road segmentation, obstacle detection, and tracking. This fusion framework uses a proposed encoder-decoder based Fully Convolutional Neural Network ({FCNx}) and a traditional Extended Kalman Filter ({EKF}) nonlinear state estimator method. It also uses a configuration of camera, {LiDAR}, and radar sensors that are best suited for each fusion method. The goal of this hybrid framework is to provide a cost-effective, lightweight, modular, and robust (in case of a sensor failure) fusion system solution. It uses {FCNx} algorithm that improve road detection accuracy compared to benchmark models while maintaining real-time efficiency that can be used in an autonomous vehicle embedded computer. Tested on over 3K road scenes, our fusion algorithm shows better performance in various environment scenarios compared to baseline benchmark networks. Moreover, the algorithm is implemented in a vehicle and tested using actual sensor data collected from a vehicle, performing real-time environment perception.},

It has proven to be a dominant technology to carry out tasks such as image classification, semantic segmentation, and object detection. The convolution neural networks surpass the performance of the existing algorithms such as {SIFT}, {HOG}, etcetera. Where, instead of manually engineering the features, supervised learning help to learn the essential low-level and high-level features necessary for classifications. The convolution neural networks have become a popular tool to counter computer vision problems. However, it is computationally, and memory intensive to train and deploy the network because of the model size of a deep convolution neural networks. However, the research in the field of design space exploration ({DSE}) of neural networks and compression techniques to develop compact architectures, have made convolution neural networks memory and computationally efficient. These techniques have also improved the feasibility of convolution neural network for deployment on embedded targets. The paper explores the concept of compact convolution filters to reduce the number of parameters in a convolution neural network. The intuition behind the approach is that replacing convolution filters with a stack of compact convolution filters helps in developing a compact architecture with competitive accuracy. This paper explores the fire module a compact convolution filter and proposes a method of recreating a state-of-the-art architecture {VGG}-16 using the fire modules to develop a compact architecture, which is further trained on the {CIFAR}-10 dataset and deployed on a real-time embedded platform known as Bluebox 2.0 by {NXP} using {RTMaps} software framework.},

When {IoT} concept meets agriculture, the future of farming is pushed to the next level, giving birth to what is called “Smart Agriculture” or “Precision Agriculture”. The most important benefit from {IoT} is that a user can daily monitor his crop online in a seamless fashion. High quality data gathered from various sensors and transferred wirelessly to farm database will increase farmers understanding to their landuse leading to increasing income and product quality. One of the monitoring process is weeds detection and crop yield estimation using camera sensors. The acquired images help farmers to build map of weeds distribution or yield quantity all over the field, these maps can be used either for real-time processing or to predetermine weeds regions based on field maps history of the previous seasons. This process is referred to as segmentation problem. Several algorithms have been proposed for that purpose, however, these algorithms were run only on high performance computers. In this paper, we evaluate performance and the robustness of the most used legacy algorithms under local conditions. We focused on implementing these schemes within real-time application constraint. For instance, these algorithms were implemented and run in a low-cost embedded system. © Springer International Publishing {AG} 2017.},

	abstract = {Multilane detection system is a vital prerequisite for realizing higher {ADAS} functionality of autonomous navigation. In this work, we present an efficient convolutional neural network ({CNN}) architecture for real time detection of multiple lane boundaries using a camera sensor. Our network has a simple encoder-decoder architecture and is a special two class semantic segmentation network designed to segment lane boundaries. Efficacy of our network stems from two key insights which are at the foundation of all our design decisions. Firstly, we term a lane boundary as a weak class object in the context of semantic segmentation. We show that the weak class objects which occupy relatively few pixels in the scene, also have a relatively low detection accuracy among the know segmentation methods. We present novel design choices and intuitions to improve the segmentation accuracy of weak class objects, which in turn reduces computation time. Our second insight lies in the manner we depict the ground truth information in our derived dataset. Instead of annotating just the visible lane markers, we accurately delineate the lane boundaries in the ground truth for challenging scenarios like occlusions, low light and degraded lane markings. We then leverage the {CNN}'s ability to concisely summarize the global and local context in an image, for accurately inferring lane boundaries in these challenging cases. We evaluate our network against {ENet} and {FCN}-8, and found it performing notably better in terms of speed and accuracy. Our network achieves an encouraging 46 {FPS} performance on {NVIDIA} Drive {PX}2 platform and it has been validated on our test vehicle in highway driving conditions. © 2018 {IEEE}.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.08469},
	abstract = {Recent success of semantic segmentation approaches on demanding road driving datasets has spurred interest in many related application fields. Many of these applications involve real-time prediction on mobile platforms such as cars, drones and various kinds of robots. Real-time setup is challenging due to extraordinary computational complexity involved. Many previous works address the challenge with custom lightweight architectures which decrease computational complexity by reducing depth, width and layer capacity with respect to general purpose architectures. We propose an alternative approach which achieves a significantly better performance across a wide range of computing budgets. First, we rely on a light-weight general purpose architecture as the main recognition engine. Then, we leverage light-weight upsampling with lateral connections as the most cost-effective solution to restore the prediction resolution. Finally, we propose to enlarge the receptive field by fusing shared features at multiple resolutions in a novel fashion. Experiments on several road driving datasets show a substantial advantage of the proposed approach, either with {ImageNet} pre-trained parameters or when we learn from scratch. Our Cityscapes test submission entitled {SwiftNetRN}-18 delivers 75.5\% {MIoU} and achieves 39.9 Hz on 1024×2048 images on {GTX}1080Ti.},

While some of these models achieve state-of-the art results and super human level performance, deploying these models in a time critical robotic environment remains an ongoing challenge. Real-time frameworks are of paramount importance to build a robotic society where humans and robots integrate seamlessly. To this end, we present a novel real-time structure prediction framework that predicts depth at 30 frames per second on an {NVIDIA}-{TX}2. At the time of writing, this is the first piece of work to showcase such a capability on a mobile platform. We also demonstrate with extensive experiments that neural networks with very large model capacities can be leveraged in order to train accurate condensed model architectures in a “from teacher to student” style knowledge transfer.},

For mass-market deployment, the embedded solution is required to address the right cost and performance envelope along with security and safety. In the case of automated driving, one of the key functionality is 'finding drivable free space', which is addressed using deep learning techniques like {CNN}. These {CNN} networks pose huge computing requirements in terms of hundreds of {GOPS}/{TOPS} (Giga or Tera operations per second), which seems beyond the capability of today's embedded {SoC}. This paper covers various techniques consisting of fixed-point conversion, sparse multiplication, fusing of layers and network pruning, for tailoring on the embedded solution. These techniques are implemented on the device by means of optimized Deep learning library for inference. The paper concludes by demonstrating the results of a {CNN} network running in real time on {TI}'s {TDA}2X embedded platform producing a high-quality drivable space output for automated driving. © 2018 {IEEE}.},

	abstract = {In the context of video segmentation with depth sensor, prior work maps the Metropolis algorithm, a simulated annealing based key routine during segmentation, onto an Nvidia Graphics Processing Unit ({GPU}) and achieves real-time performance for 320×256 video sequences. However that work utilizes depth information in a very limited manner. This paper presents a new {GPU}-based method that expands the use of depth information during segmentation and shows the improved segmentation quality over the prior work. In particular, we discuss various ways to restructure the segmentation flow, and evaluate the impact of several design choices on throughput and quality. We introduce a scaling factor for amplifying the interaction strength between two spatially neighboring pixels and increasing the clarity of borderlines. This allows us to reduce the number of required Metropolis iterations by over 50\% with the drawback of over-segmentation. We evaluate two design choices to overcome this problem. First, we incorporate depth information into the perceived color difference calculations between two pixels, and show that the interaction strengths between neighboring pixels can be more accurately modeled by incorporating depth information. Second, we pre-process the frames with Bilateral filter instead of Gaussian filter, and show its effectiveness in terms of reducing the difference between similar colors. Both approaches help improve the quality of the segmentation, and the reduction in Metropolis iterations helps improve the throughout from 29 fps to 34 fps for 320×256 video sequences.},

We use a multiple model fitting approach where each object can move independently from the background and still be effectively tracked and its shape fused over time using only the information from pixels associated with that object label. Previous attempts to deal with dynamic scenes have typically considered moving regions as outliers, and consequently do not model their shape or track their motion over time. In contrast, we enable the robot to maintain 3D models for each of the segmented objects and to improve them over time through fusion. As a result, our system can enable a robot to maintain a scene description at the object level which has the potential to allow interactions with its working environment; even in the case of dynamic scenes.},

We show that convolutional networks by themselves, trained end-to-end, pixels-to-pixels, exceed the state-of-the-art in semantic segmentation. Our key insight is to build “fully convolutional” networks that take input of arbitrary size and produce correspondingly-sized output with efficient inference and learning. We define and detail the space of fully convolutional networks, explain their application to spatially dense prediction tasks, and draw connections to prior models. We adapt contemporary classification networks ({AlexNet} [20], the {VGG} net [31], and {GoogLeNet} [32]) into fully convolutional networks and transfer their learned representations by fine-tuning [3] to the segmentation task. We then define a skip architecture that combines semantic information from a deep, coarse layer with appearance information from a shallow, fine layer to produce accurate and detailed segmentations. Our fully convolutional network achieves state-of-the-art segmentation of {PASCAL} {VOC} (20\% relative improvement to 62.2\% mean {IU} on 2012), {NYUDv}2, and {SIFT} Flow, while inference takes less than one fifth of a second for a typical image.},

A single neural network predicts bounding boxes and class probabilities directly from full images in one evaluation. Since the whole detection pipeline is a single network, it can be optimized end-to-end directly on detection performance. Our unified architecture is extremely fast. Our base {YOLO} model processes images in real-time at 45 frames per second. A smaller version of the network, Fast {YOLO}, processes an astounding 155 frames per second while still achieving double the {mAP} of other real-time detectors. Compared to state-of-the-art detection systems, {YOLO} makes more localization errors but is far less likely to predict false detections where nothing exists.

	abstract = {Key Messages E-bikes are an under-studied emerging technology with potential to facilitate sustainability agendas in urban transportation (e.g. active, multi-modal, low-carbon mobility). Little to no research has been conducted on e-bikes in Canadian urban contexts where sprawl and car dependency are predominant. E-bikes may be a viable substitute for cars for shorter commutes, yet weight, winter weather, and battery life remain barriers.},

	url = {http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214367X18300565},
	abstract = {Cycling as a mode of transportation (i.e. utility cycling) has been given heavy attention and investment in North America over the last decade. It is perceived as an environmentally friendly way to travel, leading to benefits for health and traffic alleviation. This study examines the determinants of utility cycling behaviour and intent, and more broadly, active transportation (i.e. cycling and walking) behaviour in Edmonton, Canada – the northernmost North American city with a metropolitan population over one million. With harsh winter weather and low cycling rates, the city presents a unique case study for cycling behavior. In this research, we analyzed 646 responses to a bike ridership survey conducted in 2014 by the City of Edmonton. Borrowing concepts from behaviour theory, public health and transportation engineering we seek to quantify the effects of infrastructure density, traffic attitude, perceived control over time and distance, and traffic stress tolerance perception on cycling for utility purposes, the intention to cycle more frequently, and the use of an active mode of transportation, specifically for a northern and low-cycling city. Three empirical models were developed to describe cycling behaviour using binary logistic regression. Most variables were significant and in line with other study findings in the current literature. Results point at the importance of perceived safety in deciding or intending to cycle, as well as perceived time and distance of travel. Broad policy implications and suggestions for future research are discussed.},

	abstract = {A growing number of communities in the United States are seeking to improve the sustainability of their transportation systems by shifting routine automobile travel to walking and bicycling. In order to identify strategies that may be most effective at increasing pedestrian and bicycle transportation in a specific local context, practitioners need a greater understanding of the underlying thought process that people use to select travel modes. Previous research from the travel behavior and psychology fields provides the foundation for a five-step, operational Theory of Routine Mode Choice Decisions. Walking and bicycling could be promoted through each of the five steps: awareness and availability (e.g., offer individual marketing programs), basic safety and security (e.g., make pedestrian and bicycle facility improvements and increase education and enforcement efforts), convenience and cost (e.g., institute higher-density, mixed land uses, and limited, more expensive automobile parking), enjoyment (e.g., plant street trees and increase awareness of non-motorized transportation benefits), and habit (e.g., target information about sustainable transportation options to people making key life changes). The components of the theory are supported by in-depth interview responses from the San Francisco Bay Area.},

A literature review revealed that overseas best practice is for integrated local cycling policies. Theories of diffusion of innovations and contemplation of change were highlighted and used to inform the project. A review of the New Zealand cycling market showed limited choice of and access to practical cycling tools. A survey of 234 New Zealand cyclists and non-cyclists demonstrated differences between the groups in perception of bicycles and cyclists, with more agreement for unfamiliar practical cyclists and bicycles. Practical workshops explored the effect of direct cycling experience on perceptions. A "practical cycling system design model" was proposed, along with recommendations for its implementation.},
