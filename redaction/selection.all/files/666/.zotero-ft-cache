Abstract View references (13)

The implementation of real-time edge detection and image segmentation using analog VLSI is described. A novel technique of image segmentation using radially propagating signals is discussed. Current-mode processing is used to avoid offset voltages and lead to circuit implementations which are compatible with standard CMOS processes. A system using raylike signal propagation and implemented using 3μ-CMOS technology is described together with experimental results. © 1992 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

Field-Weighted Citation Impact Field-Weighted Citation Impact shows how well cited this document is when compared to similar documents. A value greater than 1.00 means the document is more cited than expected according to the average. It takes into account:

    The year of publication
    Document type, and
    Disciplines associated with its source.

The FWCI is the ratio of the document's citations to the average number of citations received by all similar documents over a three-year window. Each discipline makes an equal contribution to the metric, which eliminates differences in researcher citation behavior.
