Jetson Nano: Deep Learning Inference Benchmarks

To run the following benchmarks on your Jetson Nano, please see the instructions here .

Jetson Nano can run a wide variety of advanced networks, including the full native versions of popular ML frameworks like TensorFlow, PyTorch, Caffe/Caffe2, Keras, MXNet, and others. These networks can be used to build autonomous machines and complex AI systems by implementing robust capabilities such as image recognition, object detection and localization, pose estimation, semantic segmentation, video enhancement, and intelligent analytics.

Figure 1 shows results from inference benchmarks across popular models available online. See here for the instructions to run these benchmarks on your Jetson Nano. The inferencing used batch size 1 and FP16 precision, employing NVIDIA’s TensorRT accelerator library included with JetPack 4.2. Jetson Nano attains real-time performance in many scenarios and is capable of processing multiple high-definition video streams.

Table 1 . Inference performance results from Jetson Nano, Raspberry Pi 3, Intel Neural Compute Stick 2, and Google Edge TPU Coral Dev Board

DNR (did not run) results occurred frequently due to limited memory capacity, unsupported network layers, or hardware/software limitations. Fixed-function neural network accelerators often support a relatively narrow set of use-cases, with dedicated layer operations supported in hardware, with network weights and activations required to fit in limited on-chip caches to avoid significant data transfer penalties. They may fall back on the host CPU to run layers unsupported in hardware and may rely on a model compiler that supports a reduced subset of a framework (TFLite, for example).

Jetson Nano’s flexible software and full framework support, memory capacity, and unified memory subsystem, make it able to run a myriad of different networks up to full HD resolution, including variable batch sizes on multiple sensor streams concurrently. These benchmarks represent a sampling of popular networks, but users can deploy a wide variety of models and custom architectures to Jetson Nano with accelerated performance. And Jetson Nano is not just limited to DNN inferencing. Its CUDA architecture can be leveraged for computer vision and Digital Signal Processing (DSP), using algorithms including FFTs, BLAS, and LAPACK operations, along with user-defined CUDA kernels.
