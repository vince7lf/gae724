Abstract View references (22)

This paper describes segmentation and tracking parts of a machine vision based airport baggage tracking system. A simplified codebook based background subtraction method is used to segment the bag from a semi-static background. Morphological processing using an integral image is used to filter the foreground mask and the bag location is found using statistical methods. The system was implemented on a cost effective embedded processor and runs in real time at 30 fps. Five ARM based embedded platforms are evaluated and it is shown that all of them are capable of the required performance. Copyright © 2014 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

Field-Weighted Citation Impact Field-Weighted Citation Impact shows how well cited this document is when compared to similar documents. A value greater than 1.00 means the document is more cited than expected according to the average. It takes into account:

    The year of publication
    Document type, and
    Disciplines associated with its source.

The FWCI is the ratio of the document's citations to the average number of citations received by all similar documents over a three-year window. Each discipline makes an equal contribution to the metric, which eliminates differences in researcher citation behavior.
