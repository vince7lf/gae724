Abstract View references (8)

Foreground/Background (FG/BG) segmentation is one of the most widely-used computer vision (CV) algorithms. Its basic algorithm takes advantages of correlation between background of different pixels or frames, predicts gray intensity for every pixel point and judges whether it belongs to foreground or background based on the prediction and actual value. Several FG/BG algorithms used in different situation were introduced firstly. Considering that those computationally expensive algorithms are hard to operate in real time using the traditional processor-based platform, its real-time embedded implementation was highlighted after this algorithm being verified. The design methodology and flow of reconfigurable computing (RC) which was an advanced method to implement those algorithms were introduced. In addition, several important issues about hardware implementation were discussed. A case of study to elaborate how it works was presented, and how to attach the implemented algorithm into the SoPC-based imaging system to achieve an integrated system was described.

Field-Weighted Citation Impact Field-Weighted Citation Impact shows how well cited this document is when compared to similar documents. A value greater than 1.00 means the document is more cited than expected according to the average. It takes into account:

    The year of publication
    Document type, and
    Disciplines associated with its source.

The FWCI is the ratio of the document's citations to the average number of citations received by all similar documents over a three-year window. Each discipline makes an equal contribution to the metric, which eliminates differences in researcher citation behavior.
