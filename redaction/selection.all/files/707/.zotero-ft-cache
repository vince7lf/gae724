FAQ

    Can I get a PDF of this book?

    No, our contract with MIT Press forbids distribution of too easily copied electronic formats of the book.
    Why are you using HTML format for the web version of the book?

    This format is a sort of weak DRM required by our contract with MIT Press. It's intended to discourage unauthorized copying/editing of the book.
    What is the best way to print the HTML format?

    Printing seems to work best printing directly from the browser, using Chrome. Other browsers do not work as well.
    Can I translate the book into Chinese?

    Posts and Telecom Press has purchased the rights.

If you notice any typos (besides the known issues listed below) or have suggestions for exercises to add to the website, do not hesitate to contact the authors directly by e-mail at: feedback@deeplearningbook.org

Since the book is complete and in print, we do not make large changes, only small corrections.

Known issues: In outdated versions of the Edge browser, the "does not equal" sign sometimes appears as the "equals" sign. This may be resolved by updating to the latest version.
