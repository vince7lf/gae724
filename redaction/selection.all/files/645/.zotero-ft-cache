Abstract View references (21)

Internet of Things (IoT) is an emerging technology where standalone equipments and autonomous devices are connected to each other and users via Internet. When IoT concept meets agriculture, the future of farming is pushed to the next level, giving birth to what is called “Smart Agriculture” or “Precision Agriculture”. The most important benefit from IoT is that a user can daily monitor his crop online in a seamless fashion. High quality data gathered from various sensors and transferred wirelessly to farm database will increase farmers understanding to their landuse leading to increasing income and product quality. One of the monitoring process is weeds detection and crop yield estimation using camera sensors. The acquired images help farmers to build map of weeds distribution or yield quantity all over the field, these maps can be used either for real-time processing or to predetermine weeds regions based on field maps history of the previous seasons. This process is referred to as segmentation problem. Several algorithms have been proposed for that purpose, however, these algorithms were run only on high performance computers. In this paper, we evaluate performance and the robustness of the most used legacy algorithms under local conditions. We focused on implementing these schemes within real-time application constraint. For instance, these algorithms were implemented and run in a low-cost embedded system. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.

Field-Weighted Citation Impact Field-Weighted Citation Impact shows how well cited this document is when compared to similar documents. A value greater than 1.00 means the document is more cited than expected according to the average. It takes into account:

    The year of publication
    Document type, and
    Disciplines associated with its source.

The FWCI is the ratio of the document's citations to the average number of citations received by all similar documents over a three-year window. Each discipline makes an equal contribution to the metric, which eliminates differences in researcher citation behavior.
