Abstract View references (23)

The Internet of Things (IoT) becomes very important tool for data gathering and management in many environments. The majority of dedicated solutions register data only at time of events, while in case of medical data full records for long time periods are usually needed. The precision of acquired data and the amount of data sent by sensor-equipped IoT devices has vital impact on lifetime of these devices. In case of solutions, where multiple sensors are available for single device with limited computation power and memory, the complex compression or transformation methods cannot be applied - especially in case of nano device injected to a body. Thus this paper is focused on linear complexity segmentation algorithms that can be used by the resource-limited devices. The state-of-art data segmentation methods are analysed and adapted for simple IoT devices. Two segmentation algorithms are proposed and tested on a real-world dataset collected from a prototype of the IoT device. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.

Field-Weighted Citation Impact Field-Weighted Citation Impact shows how well cited this document is when compared to similar documents. A value greater than 1.00 means the document is more cited than expected according to the average. It takes into account:

    The year of publication
    Document type, and
    Disciplines associated with its source.

The FWCI is the ratio of the document's citations to the average number of citations received by all similar documents over a three-year window. Each discipline makes an equal contribution to the metric, which eliminates differences in researcher citation behavior.
